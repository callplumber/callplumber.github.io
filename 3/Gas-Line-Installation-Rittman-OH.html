<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
