<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
