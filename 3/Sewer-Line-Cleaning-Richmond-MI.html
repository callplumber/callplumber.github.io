<p>In some neighborhoods, house water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to eliminate chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and ends up in our streams and lakes. In houses with personal wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic tank and then ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
<p>Diane Heether is a city resident of Belding and she is grateful for having a water softener set up in her home. It didn't just enhance and make cleaning simpler, however it assists reduce waste also.
