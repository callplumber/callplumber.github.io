Explore our water softener collection and enjoy much better water for bathing and appliances.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by hooking up a hose to drain the tank to an appropriate drain. Flushing the water heating tank should be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might provide a fast fix in the short term, it can cause much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. An excellent place to start looking for the leaking kitchen sink plumbing system is below the puddle of water or where you seem to feel the wetness most.</p>
