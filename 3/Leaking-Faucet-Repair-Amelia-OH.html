<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
