<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does happen regularly than you believe! When you don't see the water was off for a few minutes, frequently it happens at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
