<p>We focus on storm drain inspections and cleaning. Many kitchen sink blockages are due to heavy grease accumulation and food particles.

<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, but if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a larger issue to examine. You might need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is fairly brand-new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can search for your state's licensing info.
