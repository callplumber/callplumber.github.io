<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent guy. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be greater.</p>

<p>You can also depend on water softeners to reduce your everyday operating expense by conserving cleaning agent and allowing you to utilize lower water temperatures while keeping a high-quality wash. Water firmness, determined by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, varies across the U.S. from slightly hard (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a devastating impact on your company. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience much more use and tear than residential sewers and are more susceptible to obstructions and obstruction. All backflow preventers need to be tested annually by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report should be offered to us.</p>
