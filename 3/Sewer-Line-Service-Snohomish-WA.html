<p>Check the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is inexpensive and easy. But discovering the right washer may not be. The most common washers are typically offered in your home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be tough to discover. Remove it and take it to the store to find a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
