<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often becomes corrosive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in locations where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green spots being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>
<p>Homeowners can practice preventive maintenance to prevent future drainage problems. Once a. month, utilize a plunger in your shower and tub drains to remove any stuck-on particles. Pour warm water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice and salt in the garbage disposal to remove grease. Another good trick is utilizing a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap scum from getting in your pipes.</p>
