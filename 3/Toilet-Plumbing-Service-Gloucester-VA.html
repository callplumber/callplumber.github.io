<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
