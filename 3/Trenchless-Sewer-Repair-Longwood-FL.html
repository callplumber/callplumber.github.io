For double-bowl sinks, the best method to set about things is to use a continuous waste disposer kit consisting of a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such kits direct both drains to a single trap. Depending upon the place of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet kit.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.
