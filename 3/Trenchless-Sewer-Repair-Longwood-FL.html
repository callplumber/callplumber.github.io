For double-bowl sinks, the best method to set about things is to use a continuous waste disposer kit consisting of a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such kits direct both drains to a single trap. Depending upon the place of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet kit.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more.
