<p>In order to repipe your home, Cabrillo will need to remove small areas of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending on the size of your home, this procedure will likely take a few days to a week to complete. Do not stress, while we're working on your house we'll cover all of your furniture, floors and other valuables so that our work does not make a mess. After the entire process is completed and your home is cleaned up, we'll check to make sure that water is streaming effectively through all of your new pipes.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
