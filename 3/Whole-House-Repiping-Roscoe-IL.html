The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health danger or health danger conditions. They should be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only safeguard versus back siphonage.</p>
