<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
