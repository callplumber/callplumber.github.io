This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as tough water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>Bugs. Regrettably, a damaged main sewer line can likewise result in unwanted insects inside your house.
