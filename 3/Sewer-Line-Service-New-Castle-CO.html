Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
