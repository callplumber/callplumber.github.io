<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
