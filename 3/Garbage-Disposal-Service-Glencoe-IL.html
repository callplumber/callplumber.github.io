<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Glencoe IL 60022?</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
