<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Lanett AL 36863</h3>
<p>If your old disposal is broken beyond repair, you'll need to replace it. Although any broken home appliance is annoying to deal with, the good news is that setting up a replacement disposal will be more affordable than installing a brand-new garbage disposal in a sink that has never had one previously. Depending upon the pro you deal with, it can be as much as half the cost.</p>
<p>Setting up a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will normally range from $300 to $800 depending on the length of the pipe needed. If you're converting your house to gas, or if the current line is at capacity, expect to spend $2,000 or more. New gas line costs include home appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
