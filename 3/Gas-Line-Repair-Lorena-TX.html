<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, however prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction. You may be knowledgeable about galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the exact same thing, however without the zinc covering. The zinc covering on galvanized pipe for gas is suggested to keep the pipe from wearing away from contact with moisture. While it does its job quite well, in time, it still does corrode.

<p>House remodeling or house remodellings are the best time to replace your home's pipes.

<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating representative.

<p>Many homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode.
