<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide might limit the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
