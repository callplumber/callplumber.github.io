<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
