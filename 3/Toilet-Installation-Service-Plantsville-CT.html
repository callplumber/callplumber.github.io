<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
