<h3>Water Leak Repair in Hiram Georgia</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have achieved an advancement in water softening treatment using a proprietary Surface Accelerated Condensation (SACr) technology.

<p>Oregon state laws governing water supply need backflow prevention assemblies to be set up on water services where cross connections can not be removed. Backflow assemblies are required to be set up on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems. The law also needs backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as hospitals and mortuaries, as well as industrial facilities.</p>
<p>Most backflow preventers are designed to allow the elements to be removed for repair while the main body remains installed in the piping system. Getting rid of the backflow preventer to repair it is not necessary in many cases. Some parts such as relief valve bodies may need to be removed from the main body to facilitate a repair. Understanding the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
