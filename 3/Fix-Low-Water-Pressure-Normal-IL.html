Handling fixing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the cost savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can likewise be difficult to repair as they are usually situated behind the sink, in cramped areas. The best way to tighten them is with a pair of locking pliers. Wrenches take up too much space and need a wide swing angle, which might be tough to obtain in little spaces.</p>
