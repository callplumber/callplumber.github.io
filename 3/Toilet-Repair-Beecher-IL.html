<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
