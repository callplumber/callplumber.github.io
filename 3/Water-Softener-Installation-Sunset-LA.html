<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>As is the case with any plumbing appliance or water treatment system, your water softener need to be expertly set up and serviced. This is the only way to ensure that your system can manage the demand of your household, which it will actually get the job done effectively. Maintenance requirements are very little, but it does pay to have actually the system inspected for appropriate operation frequently.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that water contamination might position a severe public health risk, local laws need annual inspections to ensure your backflow prevention devices are working as they should be. Backflow preventers have springs, rubber seals and other moving parts that wear with time and it is necessary that they receivethe very same routine maintenance that your vehicle or HEATING AND COOLING system gets to guarantee your household's water is clean & safe.</p>
