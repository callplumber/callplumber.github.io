We now have cleaned and examined the components parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their components, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line. We are now ready to start the re-assembly procedure. Some models require the elements to be gotten rid of in a particular order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Lots of elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each element is put back into the body, it is essential to put them back in the right place. It is likewise crucial that as they are placed back into the body, that no foreign matter is connected on the elements or mistakenly positioned in the body.

Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are big underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
