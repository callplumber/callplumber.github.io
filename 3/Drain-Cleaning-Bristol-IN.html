<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Bristol IN</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. There is capacity for the infected water to end up being a health danger if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, as well as checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
