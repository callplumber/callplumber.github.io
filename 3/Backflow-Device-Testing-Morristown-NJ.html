<p>A newly set up water heater should not produce strange noises, but it will begin to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder in time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things get worse dramatically for homes with a high need for hot water. The factors for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement might be essential.</p>
