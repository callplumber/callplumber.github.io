<p>It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations based on water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be supplied.</p>
<p>The law also requires yearly testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report submitted to the DEP. Failure to comply can result in penalties and termination of water service.
