<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite instructions from its regular flow. IRWD's safe and clean water system is developed to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply deviate from "normal," the direction of water circulation can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the capacity for contaminated water entering the potable water distribution system.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently ends up being destructive. Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in locations where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks.</p>
