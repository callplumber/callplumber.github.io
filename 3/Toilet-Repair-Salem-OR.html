<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>The appropriate repair of a backflow preventer requires many products to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly should be assessed. The installation needs to be assessed to ensure it does not prevent the functions of the assembly. Test data must be built up to figure out the functions of each element. The backflow prevention assembly should be dismantled and parts replaced with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly need to be tested again to be sure it was properly fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow diagram is essential to guarantee it was repaired properly. An appropriately repaired assembly should offer years of defense.</p>
