<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Kamuela HI 96743?</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
