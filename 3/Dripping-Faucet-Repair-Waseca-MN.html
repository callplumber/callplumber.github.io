<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite direction from its normal flow. IRWD's drinkable water system is developed to keep the water flowing to you.

<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to employ a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair costs may be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the new heater.</p>
