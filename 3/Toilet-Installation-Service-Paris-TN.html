<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a disastrous effect on your business. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more tear and wear than residential sewage systems and are more vulnerable to blockages and obstruction. All backflow preventers must be checked each year by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report should be provided to us.</p>
<p>Metal alloys are susceptible to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration. Rust can literally consume a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or modify the tolerances triggering parts to not operate in a backflow preventer. The result of corrosion on a metal alloy need to be evaluated to identify if the part is usable or need to be replaced.</p>
