If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable option, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
