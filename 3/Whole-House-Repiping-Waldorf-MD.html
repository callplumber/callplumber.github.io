<p>Water discoloration: Another obvious sign of your pipes decaying is brown or yellow water coming out of your sinks or tub. Action 2: On the new drain, use plumber's putty around the flange, and press it into place. Then lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the flange to keep it from moving.
