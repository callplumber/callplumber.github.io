Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable coating, these are big underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
