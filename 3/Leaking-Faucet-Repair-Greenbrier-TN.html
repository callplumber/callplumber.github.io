<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
