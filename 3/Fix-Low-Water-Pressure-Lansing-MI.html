<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the faulty pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, however steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
