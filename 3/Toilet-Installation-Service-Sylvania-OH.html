Most garbage disposals are plug-in, as it is much safer to have a vibrating unit come unplugged then disconnected from stationary electrical wiring.

Any motorist who disregards a leaky fuel line is obviously at serious danger of becoming a fire casualty, Lavacot says, as gas is spurting from their vehicle somewhere.
