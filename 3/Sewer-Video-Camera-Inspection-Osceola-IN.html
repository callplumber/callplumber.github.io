<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
