Get it fixed as quickly as you can if you discover a leak. Connecting irrigation to fountains, pool and garden ponds prohibited: State law and City regulation hold that no irrigation system might be connected to a water fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond. These water functions may only be filled with drinkable water. Water which has actually gone into an irrigation system is not safe and clean.</p>
