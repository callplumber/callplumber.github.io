<p>Seattle Public Utilities checks backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be evaluated by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report need to be provided to us. Get cleaner clothing, remove rust areas, and utilize less cleaning agent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house models are proper for washing devices, or you can try laundry additive water softening items.</p>

Then they are replaced in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
