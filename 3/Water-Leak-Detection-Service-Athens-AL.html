<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
