The biggest of these main long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
