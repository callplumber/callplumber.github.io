The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if expensive) device is best utilized in crucial areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
