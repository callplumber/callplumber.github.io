<p>Whether you need garbage disposal repair or installation, Maeser can help. A garbage disposal is a necessary kitchen home appliance in most homes today. While most kitchen sink disposers can handle practically any sort of food waste, they are not unbreakable.

Used impellers on older disposals can become ineffective, increasing the threat of drain obstructions.</p>
