<p>Leaks are sly. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
