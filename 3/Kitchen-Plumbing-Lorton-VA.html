<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Lorton VA 22079</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
