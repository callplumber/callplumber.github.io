<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that must likewise be well maintained to help prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to break and harden or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak.

All that has to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, allowing hard water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, relocated to its brand-new location and placed there.</p>
