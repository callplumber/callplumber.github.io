<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Wallingford PA 19086</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Changed 50 gallon electrical hot water heater, thermal growth tank, and pressure regulator valve. When most people think about plumbers, they usually call them for water pipe issues. The natural gas plumber will have a license that states he or she is licensed to deal with and install natural gas lines. Homeowners must think about whether the plumber has a master plumbing license, which symbolizes a high degree of experience, credentials and knowledge.</p>
<p>Our bathroom and kitchen sinks are something we take for approved until they start acting up. And it so occurs that our bathroom and kitchen sinks start acting up at the most troublesome times, like when we're having over dinner visitors, or when we're running late for operate in the early morning. Think about a tankless water heater if you're looking to conserve on energy costs and would like hot water on demand. These units require less maintenance and last longer (over twenty years) than the standard hot water heater.</p>
