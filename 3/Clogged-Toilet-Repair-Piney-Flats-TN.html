<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Some softeners deal with electrical power, but some more recent water softeners use waterpower.

Accumulation in pipes can also result in an increase of water pressure, which can harm the whole sewer system and significantly increase the chances of a pipe breaking due to stress.</p>
