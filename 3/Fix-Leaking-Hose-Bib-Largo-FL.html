It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
