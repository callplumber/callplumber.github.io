<p>CPM Plumbing concentrates on swift service, accurate troubleshooting, and precision repairs so your business never needs to suffer from downtime. To keep your sink smelling fresh and running clear, pour in equal parts of vinegar and baking soda on a regular basis. For regular cleaning, you'll just need about one-half cup of each.

<p>Prior to selection and installation, refer to makers literature for temperature level ranges. All assemblies should be protected from freezing temperature levels and if installed where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly must be utilized.
