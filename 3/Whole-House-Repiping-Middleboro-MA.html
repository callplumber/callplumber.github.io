Constantly continue to run water during and after using your disposal. Preferably, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has actually vanished down the drain.</p>

Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it.

When you have actually protected the journey lever and are all set to link your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
