The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in size to provide sufficient circulation.</p>
<p>When a plumbing license has actually been issued in mistake since of incorrect, incomplete or incorrect info, or the work for which the authorization was released breaks the Uniform Code, such license will be revoked or suspended till such time as the authorization holder demonstrates that all work completed and all work proposed will remain in compliance with applicable arrangements of the code.</p>
