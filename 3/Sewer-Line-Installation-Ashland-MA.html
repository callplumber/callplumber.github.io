If your energy bills are increasing, a new, higher effectiveness hot water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is closing off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, enabling hard water to flow to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, transferred to its new area and positioned there.</p>
