<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
