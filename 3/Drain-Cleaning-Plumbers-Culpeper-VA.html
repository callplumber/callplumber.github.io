<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
