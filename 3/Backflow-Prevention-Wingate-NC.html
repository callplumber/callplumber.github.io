<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To remove the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Eliminate the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Wingate NC</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>A plumbing inspection is a systematic process of evaluating the important areas of the plumbing system of a home.
