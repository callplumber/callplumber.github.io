<p>When compared to gas models, electric designs are easier and more economical to install as electricity is already offered through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line needs to be installed and a viable source of gas developed. Another feature of an electric water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated properly using vents and ducts in order to work properly. With electrical models, you will not have to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>

The result of our sophisticated water softener technology is healthier, smoother water for you and your family, while still keeping an effective circulation rate.</p>
