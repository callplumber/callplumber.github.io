<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Tankless electrical water heaters can be found in 2 types. There are whole-house heaters that are big and effective enough to provide hot water to all bathrooms, cooking areas, and appliances in a home. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electric heaters that supply warm water to particular spaces or devices only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the same way. The only difference is the amount of water they can heat up at any provided time. Likewise, whole-house units are substantially more expensive than the point of usage units.</p>
