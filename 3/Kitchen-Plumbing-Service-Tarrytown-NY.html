<p>106.2.2.1 Besides Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent rule exemptions in Section 106.2.2 shall apply to minor repairs and replacement piping only. In buildings aside from Group R-3 tenancies, a permit and inspection will be required for more comprehensive work if more than 10-percent (small) of a floor level, area, or wing is included, despite the fact that the floor level, wing, or area specifies less than 10-percent (nominal) of the total structure plumbing.</p>
