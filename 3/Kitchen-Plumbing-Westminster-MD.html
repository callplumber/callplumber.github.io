<p>The key to the innovation is having the ability to control both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thus eliminating firmness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active websites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are thought about a health danger if backflows occur from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be suggested on building plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond need to be tested upon installation and then every year.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
