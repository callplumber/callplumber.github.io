<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Saratoga Springs NY</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
