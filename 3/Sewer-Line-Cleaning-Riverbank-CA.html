<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions.

For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is simply recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
