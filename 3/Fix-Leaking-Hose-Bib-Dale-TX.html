<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and fulfill our rigid trust certification requirements. An excellent guideline is to replace faucets that show deterioration, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Worn out and rusted parts make repairs difficult and expensive, suggesting a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the correct fix for issues such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the whole component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
