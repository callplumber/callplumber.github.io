<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and satisfy our rigid trust certification requirements. A great general rule is to replace faucets that show rust, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Worn out and corroded parts make repairs challenging and expensive, indicating a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the right fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the entire component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>When a plumbing license has been issued in error since of inaccurate, inaccurate or incomplete information, or the work for which the license was released breaches the Uniform Code, such authorization shall be revoked or suspended until such time as the authorization holder shows that all work completed and all work proposed shall be in compliance with appropriate provisions of the code.</p>

<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Haleyville AL</h3>
<p>Rusty water: If you have rusty water coming out of your faucets, especially if that water is hot, the inside of your system is most likely rusty. You will likely have to replace your hot water heater if it just happens with hot water. If you resemble many property owners, you probably do not know what kind of pipes you have. A plumber from 1st Option Plumbing can tell you for sure, however in general, there are 3 main types of pipes that tend to have problems.</p>
<p>Seeing high water pressure at plumbing components in your home? Water pressure in the house is similar to blood pressure in the body - it needs to be controlled to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure causes damage to the plumbing system, this can result in emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator installed is FAR MORE cost-effective than mold remediation or changing floor covering or drywall! So we advise setting up or fixing water pressure regulators to protect your whole house.</p>
