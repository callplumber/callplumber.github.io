<p>Leakages are sly. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
