<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
