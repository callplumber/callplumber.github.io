<p>A water softener is composed of a mineral tank and a backflush tank. It gathers solidity minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are typically used for water softening.

The result of our sophisticated water softener innovation is healthier, smoother water for you and your household, while still maintaining an efficient circulation rate.</p>
