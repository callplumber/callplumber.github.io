<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Summerville GA 30747</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending on the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be removed and replaced with new rubber parts. It is important that only initial factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to utilize and changing the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
