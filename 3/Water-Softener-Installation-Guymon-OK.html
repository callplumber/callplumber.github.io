<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
