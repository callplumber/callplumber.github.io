<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Reserve LA</h3>
<p>A freshly installed hot water heater must not produce strange noises, however it will begin to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder over time as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things intensify dramatically for families with a high need for warm water.

If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement may be necessary.</p>
