Other good alternatives are overload defense, which turns off the motor if it begins to get too hot; an auto-reverse feature to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the dirty dishes get ground up in the disposal. And if your house is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal particularly designed to be used with a septic system. provides a summary 1 of waste disposal unit and septic tanks.</p>
<p>The anode rod in your water heater is developed to bring in corrosion-causing components in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from rusting. The best way to prevent drain obstructions is to view what you flush. If you look at your home's plumbing pipes and see discolorations, staining, flaking, little indentations or rust, your pipes are corroding.
