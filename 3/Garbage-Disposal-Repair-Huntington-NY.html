While these are affordable at first buy, they are not the most efficient or reliable method for you to get hot water, particularly if your unit is obsoleted.

That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration instantly starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regrowth normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
