<p>Your disposer may feature a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, rather of the conventional plumber's putty as detailed below.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
