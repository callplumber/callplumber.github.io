<p>When you depend on Roto-Rooter for hot water heater replacement, maintenance or repair, you can expect professional service from proficient plumbing experts. Backflow prevention devices operate by enabling water to stream in only one direction. In an unguarded water service connection, potable water can stream both in and out of a structure or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a structure for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water backwards into the water system. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from cars and truck cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may get in the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development might flow in reverse into the safe and clean water supply.

With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal particles can sometimes get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>
