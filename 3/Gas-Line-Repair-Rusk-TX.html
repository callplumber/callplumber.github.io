<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>

<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Rusk TX 75785!</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program safeguards the public supply of water from contaminants and pollutants that could, under specific circumstances, be drawn into the public water system from private properties. The cost mostly depends on the toilet you choose if you need a brand-new toilet. Toilets vary in style, flushing efficiency and bowl shape, all of which make some toilets more expensive than others. When installing a new toilet, the plumber may also need to make modifications to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the total cost of the task.</p>
