<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically two layers of security. The device allows water to push the check valves open when water is entering into the structure, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the wrong way.

There are a couple of others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. I discuss them just due to the fact that they will be on a certification test.</p>
