<p>Backflow is bad news. After an inspection has been arranged utilizing the Permits and Inspections Online Permitting Service scheduling system, inspectors might be called in between 8:00 am - 9:00 am the day of the inspection. The inspectors will organize their day-to-day work schedules and do not know what inspections have actually been asked for prior to the inspection date.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically two layers of security. The device allows water to push the check valves open when water is entering into the structure, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the wrong way. There are two different types of testable backflow prevention devices that are typically specified-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. I discuss them just due to the fact that they will be on a certification test.</p>
