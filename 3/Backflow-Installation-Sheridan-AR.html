<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 various occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a big mess. They, just like each person we've come across with Plumb Crazy, were polite, prompt, and very well-informed. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anybody requiring either little or big job plumbing work.</p>
