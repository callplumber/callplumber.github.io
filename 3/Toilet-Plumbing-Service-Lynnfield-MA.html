<p>The basic work week for plumbers is 40 hours (8 hours a day, 5 days a week). Similar to lots of careers in building, there are peak durations that will need you to work overtime. The number of additional hours you work weekly depends on the construction sector and region you operate in, and will vary from one job to the next. In time, the limescale buildup caused by hard water can lead to costly plumbing repairs. A RainSoft water conditioner can help avoid premature wear and tear on your toilet.</p>
<p>This article aims to address the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: a properly set up water softener does not make the cured water more destructive. Here are a few confusing truths that frequently lead people to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is generally corrosive.
