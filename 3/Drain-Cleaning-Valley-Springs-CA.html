<p>Next, check the body. Depending upon the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again crucial for the repair service technician to be aware of the hardness of the materials so that their cleaning procedure is not harmful. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to lessen any scale development or rust.
