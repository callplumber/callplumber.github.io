<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water.

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
