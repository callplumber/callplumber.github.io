<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
