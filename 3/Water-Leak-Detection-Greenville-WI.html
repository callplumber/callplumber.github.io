<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
