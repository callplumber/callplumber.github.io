<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation.
