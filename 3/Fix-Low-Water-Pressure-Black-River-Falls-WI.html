<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well maintained to assist avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to break and solidify or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
