<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that result. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
