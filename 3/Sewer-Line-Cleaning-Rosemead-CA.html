<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to eliminate chloride.

<p>Firstly, never plant anything up against your house, in front of windows, nor close to your lateral. (Your lateral is the major line from your house to the city line.) You might have a concept of where your lateral is situated if you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not know, invest the minimal cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, and even dig into and break the line. If you are working with someone to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the areas to prevent. If you have a clean-out, your line will be simple to determine.</p>
<p>Al Rinckey started A&T Softwater 20 years back from his house. In that time, he has set up several water softeners in the area and continues to see an uptick in his service. While he estimates that 6 to 1 systems are set up in homes outside of city limits with well water, locals within the city limits of Belding, Greenville, Sheridan and Rockford are buying water softeners and reverse osmosis systems.</p>
