<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or short-lived connection in between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
