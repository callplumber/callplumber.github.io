<p>Insecticide from garden pipes: The extremely hazardous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply.

"Detection Innovation for Pipeline Plugging Based Upon Barotropic Wave Technique." Gas Market 26, no. 4 (2006 ): 112.

<p>Disadvantages to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
