<p>Next, examine the body. Depending upon the size and maker, the bodies can be made from bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again important for the repair technician to be familiar with the solidity of the materials so that their cleaning procedure is not harmful. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to minimize any scale development or deterioration. It is essential that the repair service technician is delicate to the solidity and type of the various finishes used on iron body systems so as not to damage the protective finishing.</p>
