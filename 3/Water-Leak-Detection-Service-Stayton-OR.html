<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
