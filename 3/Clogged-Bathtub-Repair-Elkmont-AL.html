While many kitchen sink disposers can manage almost any sort of food waste, they are not unbreakable.

<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are considered a health threat if backflows take place from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place need to be shown on building plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond must be tested upon installation and then annually.</p>
<p>Metal alloys are vulnerable to an electro-chemical condition called rust. Corrosion can literally consume a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or alter the tolerances triggering parts to not operate in a backflow preventer. If the part is usable or should be replaced, the impact of rust on a metal alloy should be examined to determine.</p>
