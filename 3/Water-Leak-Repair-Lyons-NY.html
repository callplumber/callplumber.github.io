<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are set up in locations where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
