When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. If permitted to re-enter the water system, there is capacity for the infected water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, as well as checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
