<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Cardiff By The Sea CA 92007</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated appropriately in the drain locknut, then tighten the drain and reinstall locknut. Finally, switch on the water and test for leakages.</p>
