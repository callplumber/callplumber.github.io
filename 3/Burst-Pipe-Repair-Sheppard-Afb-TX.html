It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
