<p>A few of Pennsylvania's 2,562 municipalities have developed local licensure or accreditation requirements for contractors or building trades individuals. Usually, these requirements refer to home improvement contractors, electrical contractors (or electrical contractors), and plumbing contractors (or plumbers). Because the Commonwealth has no jurisdiction in this matter, the Department maintains no records worrying municipalities that have actually established licensure or accreditation requirements. This information can only be acquired by calling the town where construction work will take place.</p>
