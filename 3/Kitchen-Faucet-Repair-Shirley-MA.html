<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Immediate toilet repair is essential to the safety of your patrons and workers. From commercial toilet drain service to unclogging commercial toilets, Roto-Rooter plumbers can do all of it. Move the brand-new hot water heater into location, recut or extend the old tubing to fulfill the brand-new, and solder the tubing together utilizing copper slip couplings. Balance out the lines as required with sets of 45-degree elbows if the tubing doesn't line up.</p>
<p>To link a power cord to the new unit, remove the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their counterparts in the cable, utilizing wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation.
