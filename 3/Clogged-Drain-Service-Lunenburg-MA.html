<p>Please let EBMUD know of any scenario that may require a backflow device. Sometimes conditions on homes change that may need a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with additives or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than an inconvenience for your service, they can trigger financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your organisation entirely.

<p>Depending on the size of your home, repiping might take anywhere from a number of days to a week. Typically, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires total water turned off while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience minimal disturbance to your daily regimen. To start the repiping procedure, the plumbing team will first cover any carpet and furnishings to secure them from dust and particles. They will then make little cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and after that remove and replace them, leaving as much of the original structure material as possible undamaged.</p>
