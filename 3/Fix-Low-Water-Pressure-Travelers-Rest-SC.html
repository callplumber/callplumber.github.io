<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are considered a health threat if backflows happen from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place must be suggested on building and construction plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a water fountain or garden pond should be checked upon installation and then each year.</p>
<p>If there is a leak, we will find the leak and shut the gas line down at the main line if it has not currently been finished. Then, our professional will dig to find the gas line and leak. The gas line will be replaced and pressure evaluated to guarantee there are no leakages. The site will be tidied up and restored to its previous splendor if the leak is sufficiently repaired.</p>

This usually costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot light might need to be relit, the gas line may be clogged or need repair. The flowers or plants near the gas leak will be discolored or degraded if the gas line is harmed. Contact our specialists to identify the extent of the issue.</p>
