That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system determines the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically starts. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Tough water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals.
