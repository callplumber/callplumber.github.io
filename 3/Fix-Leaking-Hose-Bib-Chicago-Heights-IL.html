Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such models are practical.</p>
