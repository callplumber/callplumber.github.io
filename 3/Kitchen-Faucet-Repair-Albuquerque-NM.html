If your disposal is frequently making noises that are irregular for the machine, it might be in need of significant repairs or it could be nearing the end of its life-span. Regular obstructions, even when you're hardly washing down any food particles, might show a problem with the disposal. If there are leaks originating from your system, it is most likely due to excessive use over an extended period of time. Much of these leaks can be repaired, however if they end up being larger and more frequent, you need to consider overall system replacement.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
