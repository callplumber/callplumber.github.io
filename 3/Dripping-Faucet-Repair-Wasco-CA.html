<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of.

So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
