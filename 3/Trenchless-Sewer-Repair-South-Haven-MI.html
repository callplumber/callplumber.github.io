<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe in South Haven MI 49090</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the marketplace and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>

<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mostly time associated. If everything is all set, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the overall expenses. A lot of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
