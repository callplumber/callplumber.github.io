<p>If your old disposal is broken beyond repair, you'll have to replace it. Although any broken device is frustrating to deal with, the bright side is that installing a replacement disposal will be more affordable than installing a new garbage disposal in a sink that has never ever had one in the past. Depending upon the pro you work with, it can be as much as half the price.</p>
<p>Just how much is a sewer line inspection? These specialized evaluations include specialized camera devices that runs into your sewer line. If you have actually spotted pooling water in the lawn, a camera inspection is a lot more tasty than trenching through the yard. This will cost you (usually) between $300-$ 400.
