For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to crack and solidify or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the location.
