<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
