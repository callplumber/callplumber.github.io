We will repair it again-no charge if a repair or devices that we have actually supplied and set up stops working in the first year.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are installed in big, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed.
