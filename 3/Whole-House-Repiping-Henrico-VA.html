<p>Fragrance Release - Sink flanges are available for around $30 that seals the top of the unit to prevent odors. Make sure that the plumbing throughout the home is gotten ready for freezing weather by having actually pipes wrapped. The vents throughout the house should be the type that can be closed off in the winter season time during periods of intense cold.

Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; retrieve the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer.
