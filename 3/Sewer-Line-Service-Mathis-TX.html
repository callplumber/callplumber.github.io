<p>Next, check the body. Depending upon the size and producer, the bodies can be made from bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron.

In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to minimize any scale growth or deterioration. It is important that the repair specialist is delicate to the solidity and kind of the different coatings used on iron body systems so as not to damage the protective finish.</p>
