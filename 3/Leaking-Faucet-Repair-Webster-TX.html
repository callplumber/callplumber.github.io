One way to test for any leakages in your plumbing is to shut off all water appliances in your home and outdoors (sprinklers, pipes, and so on).

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent.

This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to restore and enter the valve pressure equivalent to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
