The largest of these main long-distance transmitting pipes are described as aqueducts. Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
