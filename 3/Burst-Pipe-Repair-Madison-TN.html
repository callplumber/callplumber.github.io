<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is one of the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health threat or health threat conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not enable the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and online in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>

Rust can actually eat a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or modify the tolerances causing parts to not operate in a backflow preventer. The impact of deterioration on a metal alloy should be evaluated to determine if the part is functional or need to be replaced.</p>
