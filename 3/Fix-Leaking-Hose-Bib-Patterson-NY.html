<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The majority of backflow preventers are created to allow the parts to be eliminated for repair while the main body stays installed in the piping system. Eliminating the backflow preventer to repair it is not needed in most cases. Some parts such as relief valve bodies may need to be eliminated from the main body to help with a repair. Understanding the appropriate order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
