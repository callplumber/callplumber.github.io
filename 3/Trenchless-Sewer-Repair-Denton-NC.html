Depending upon the pro you deal with, it can be as much as half the price.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks online and off-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
