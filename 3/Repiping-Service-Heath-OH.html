<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that need to also be well kept to help avoid leakages and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to break and harden or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>

<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic system from your house. When you experience clogs in numerous drains at the same time in your house, then that usually indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can happen in multiple areas and any mix of drains. For instance, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>Testing must be completed by a contractor signed up with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor must have a legitimate, current plumbing license, current insurance, backflow preventer testing accreditation, and presently calibrated test package. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is needed.</p>
