<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
<p>A Pilot burner That Has Gone Out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you utilize a gas hot water heater rather than a system with an electrical heating aspect, there is a great chance your pilot burner has gone out. This might be since of an issue with your thermocouple, a lack of combustible air, or merely a strong breeze. Regardless of what the problem is, however, your water heater will not be able to work up until the pilot burner is re-lit.</p>

Idea: Place a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are deteriorating gradually from the inside. In most cases, repiping is your only practical alternative.</p>
