Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel eventually struggles with rust and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
