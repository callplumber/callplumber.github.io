<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To get rid of the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the large, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away. Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
