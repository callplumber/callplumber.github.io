<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load.
