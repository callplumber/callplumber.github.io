<p>Responsive flow innovation works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and on-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>Similar to kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, sink, or shower) can be remedied quickly if the obstruction is shallow and simple. For a lot of blockages you'll just need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, however if this doesn't solve the problem then you may also have to hire a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is likewise harder to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
