<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Acton CA</h3>
<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather security. As the external covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- generally sodium. The result is water that's been successfully softened by getting rid of almost all traces of the minerals that make up tough water.</p>
