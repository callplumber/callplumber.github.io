<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
