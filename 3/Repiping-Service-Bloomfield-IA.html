When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. If enabled to return to the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health risk.
