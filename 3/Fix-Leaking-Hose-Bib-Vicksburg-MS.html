<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>

Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are all set to link your flapper, make sure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
