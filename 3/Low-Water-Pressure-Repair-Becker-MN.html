<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and intricate plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
