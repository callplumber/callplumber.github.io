<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can position problems.</p>

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continuously bringing tanks on-line and off-line in action to the water needs of your carwash.

Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
