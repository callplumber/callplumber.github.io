<p>Have actually used Plumb Crazy on three different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were great. They quickly found the leak and repaired it without making a big mess. They, similar to each person we've experienced with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, prompt, and extremely educated. I would suggest Plumb Crazy to anyone requiring either big or little task plumbing work.</p>
<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be removed and replaced with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that only initial factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to use and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
