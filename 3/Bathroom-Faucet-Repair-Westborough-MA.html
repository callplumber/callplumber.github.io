<p>Most homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather defense. As the external coating of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>If your problem is more related to scale and mineral accumulation, it's important to be conscious that a lot of scale and mineral accumulation in toilet bowls is triggered by tough water. Tough water normally leaves lime and calcium accumulation which can become quite undesirable. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning approaches will certainly assist, we highly recommend you look into installing a water softener to help with your hard water.</p>
