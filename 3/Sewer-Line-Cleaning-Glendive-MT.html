But if the leakage concerns are frequent and every once in a while some or the other corner of your house has water leaking, then it's time to call a plumber to examine the entire piping system to perform home repiping. Several leaks shouldn't be overlooked at all; else it might cause complicated flooding concern soon.</p>
