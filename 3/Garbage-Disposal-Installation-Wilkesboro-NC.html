<p>Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the safe and clean supply of water within a structure these gadgets are known as isolation" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no chance to supply one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed.

Your line will be easy to identify if you have a clean-out.</p>
