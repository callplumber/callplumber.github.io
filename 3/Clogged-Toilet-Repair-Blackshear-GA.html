<p>Video cameras are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing organisation. Identify the size of the water pipes in the home and around the home - they will help to figure out the water pressure that you'll have.

The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in size to offer appropriate circulation.</p>
