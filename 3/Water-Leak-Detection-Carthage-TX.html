<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your water heater installation consultation. Installing gas lines can bring a new level of service. As tough water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water stick to the beads, and the cured water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>

The distinction is brighter laundry, softer towels and sparkling dishes. Soft water is better for house devices, too. Discover the advantages of Morton Water Softener Salt.
