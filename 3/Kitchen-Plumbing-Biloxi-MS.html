<p>Sewer lines have one essential role: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very expensive alternative.</p>
