<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>

<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Christiansburg VA 24073</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system.
