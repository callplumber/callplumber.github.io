<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractor in Lewis Center</h2>

For the most part, the homeowner is responsible for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Some states need pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they may likewise require an unique license to deal with gas lines. Licensing typically requires a test or work experience or both.
