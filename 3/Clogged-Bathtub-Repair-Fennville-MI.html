<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each component. If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the part, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities.
