<p>Prior to installing, your professional will shut off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a new mounting ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is attached to its mount. In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get sped up.</p>
