<p>CPM Plumbing focuses on quick service, accurate troubleshooting, and precision repairs so your service never has to suffer from downtime. If there is a leak, one thing to know about gas lines is they can be exceptionally hazardous. While gas leaks are uncommon, you need to leave the building immediately if you observe a smell like rotten eggs in your home. A gas leak can have nearly immediate results on those exposed to it, and it can even be deadly. Get out of the house and call us immediately if you have actually got a gas pipe leaking.</p>
<p>The anode rod in your water heater is created to bring in corrosion-causing components in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from wearing away. The best method to avoid drain clogs is to view what you flush. If you look at your house's plumbing pipes and see stains, staining, flaking, little indentations or rust, your pipes are rusting. Rusting pipes are most likely to spring a leak (if they have not already) and should be changed as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical compound that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup might still occur.</p>
