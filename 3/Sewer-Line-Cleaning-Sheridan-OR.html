<h3>Types Of Blocked Drain Cleaning Equipment at Sheridan OR 97378</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
