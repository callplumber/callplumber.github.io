<p>Last but not least, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water flows at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>

<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
