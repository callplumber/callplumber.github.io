Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content.

Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
