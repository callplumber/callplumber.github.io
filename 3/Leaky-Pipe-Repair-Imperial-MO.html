<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
