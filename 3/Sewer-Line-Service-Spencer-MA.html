<h3>How to Repair Kitchen Faucets in Spencer MA 01562</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you discover your water has an unusual circulation, taste, smell or color. A plumbing professional can determine whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other concerns in your house's plumbing system. More complicated problems with water temperature or pressure may need changing the water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
