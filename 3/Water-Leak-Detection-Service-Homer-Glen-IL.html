<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as difficult water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be discovered near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Warning: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Since copper is showing does not indicate you do not have polybutylene pipes, simply. You may need to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>The typical solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel ultimately struggles with rust and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
