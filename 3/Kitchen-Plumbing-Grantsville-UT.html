<p>You can also depend on water softeners to lower your daily operating costs by saving cleaning agent and enabling you to use lower water temperature levels while maintaining a premium wash. Water firmness, determined by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, differs across the U.S. from slightly difficult (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
