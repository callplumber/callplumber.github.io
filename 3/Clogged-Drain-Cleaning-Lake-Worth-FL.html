<p>Water softeners add value to your operation by protecting your water-using equipment from bad efficiency and early failure. Some difficult water problems are extremely visible, like dispensers and sprayers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go undetected, like scale on water heater components and buildup in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Visible or unnoticeable, these problems have real expenses associated with them. Clogged fixtures trigger replacement or reconditioning expenses and can irritate your consumers.
