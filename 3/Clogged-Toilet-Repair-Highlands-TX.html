<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals.
