<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are likewise fueled by gas or electrical energy, however they do not save water within the unit. They are compact and only heat water as needed, making them more environmentally friendly. Tankless water heaters generally need a higher initial investment, but they are less costly to run and provide fringe benefits like limitless hot water.</p>
