If you see a leak, get it repaired as quickly as you can. Linking watering to water fountains, swimming pools and garden ponds prohibited: State law and City regulation hold that no watering system might be connected to a water fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond. These water functions may just be filled with potable water. Water which has gotten in a watering system is not drinkable.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems normally are installed in large, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
