It could be in need of major repairs or it might be nearing the end of its lifespan if your disposal is frequently making sounds that are irregular for the machine. Regular clogs, even when you're hardly washing down any food particles, could indicate a problem with the disposal. It is most likely due to too much use over a long duration of time if there are leaks coming from your system. Much of these leaks can be fixed, but if they become larger and more regular, you must think about total system replacement.</p>
