<p>Galvanized piping is accountable for a minimum of half of the plumbing emergencies that we encounter in the houses around the Bay Area.

It can also trigger stains in clothes put in the washing machine. If your house is over 50 years old, it's a great bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and an optimum of $15,000. The large disparity in price is due to the size of your home, the kind of pipe you're installing, and additional repairs you discover you need to make whenever you go behind walls.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. Since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, usually regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
