<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide.

If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
