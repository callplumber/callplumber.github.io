<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
