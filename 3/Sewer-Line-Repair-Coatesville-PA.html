<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
