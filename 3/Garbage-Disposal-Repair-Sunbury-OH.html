Continuous feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal particles can in some cases get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>

Apprentice programs are the most common way for plumbers to find out the skills needed to become successful in the trade.
