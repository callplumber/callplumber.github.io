You will likely have to replace your hot water heater if it just occurs with hot water. If you're like a lot of house owners, you probably don't understand what kind of pipes you have.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
