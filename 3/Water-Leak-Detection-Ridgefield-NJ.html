Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom house expenses $4,000 to $10,000, and requires cutting open walls and floorings, so you certainly don't want to get the job done before it's necessary. When it's time for replacement, here's how to examine your plumbing system and understand.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or irreversible connection in between a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
