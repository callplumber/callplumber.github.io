<p>Identification of air, liquid and gas leakages: Using electronic, acoustical and thermal imaging finding devices to identify leakages. Current advances in toilet innovation have made modern restrooms a lot more comfortable and practical. If your toilet was manufactured prior to 1994, then it's likely costing you money every day. New toilets utilize almost 2 gallons less per flush while offering the very same or much better flushing power as their outdated equivalents.
