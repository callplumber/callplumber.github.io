When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated appropriately.

<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Mission Viejo CA</h3>
<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
