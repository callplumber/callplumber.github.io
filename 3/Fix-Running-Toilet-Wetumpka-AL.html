<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
