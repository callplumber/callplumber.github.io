If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet).
