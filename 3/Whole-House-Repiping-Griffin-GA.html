<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Griffin GA</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your lawn. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Main sewer repair involves comprehensive excavation, supporting supporting walls, getting rid of and communicating pipe and connections, backfilling, and installing plates for temporary cover. Service lines which originate from private property and feed into the main line are a normal area for breaks or leakages. Off-road jobs outside the right of way require a great deal of manual work for excavation and hauling products, rock, and dirt to and from the site.</p>
