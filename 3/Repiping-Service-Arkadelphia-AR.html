<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
