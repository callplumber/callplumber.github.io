Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
