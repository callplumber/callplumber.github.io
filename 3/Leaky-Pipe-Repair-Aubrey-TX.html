<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration instantly begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complex scientific process, but simple to remedy. It uses salt to remove smells and minerals found in hard water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attach and draw in salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press hard water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
