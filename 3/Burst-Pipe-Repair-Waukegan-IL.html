<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Waukegan IL</h3>
<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
<p>Thankfully this is a relatively inexpensive plumbing repair, and can help extend the life of your hot water heater.
