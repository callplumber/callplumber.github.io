<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Angier NC</h3>
<p>A newly installed water heater must not produce odd noises, however it will start to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder with time as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things intensify significantly for families with a high need for hot water. The factors for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to bring back normalcy. A hot water heater replacement may be required if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
