Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with.

For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
