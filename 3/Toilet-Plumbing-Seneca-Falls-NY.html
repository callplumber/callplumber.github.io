<p>Installed under the sink, the waste disposal unit is indicated for slicing up small bits of waste food. When switched on the motor spins and impellers-- also called lugs-- toss bits of food against a grinder ring.

<p>Mixing evaporated salt with rock salt is not recommended, as this could clog the softening reservoir. It is suggested that you allow your unit to go empty of one type of salt before adding another to avoid the occurrence of any problems.

And make certain a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
