<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and fulfill our rigid trust accreditation standards. A good rule of thumb is to replace faucets that reveal deterioration, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and rusted parts make repairs difficult and expensive, suggesting a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the proper fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
