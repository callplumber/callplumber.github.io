<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are primarily time related. If everything is ready, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours required and for that reason the overall expenses. A lot of plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor expenses roughly $150.</p>
