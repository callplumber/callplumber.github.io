When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
