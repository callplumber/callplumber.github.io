<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Nashua NH 03060</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
