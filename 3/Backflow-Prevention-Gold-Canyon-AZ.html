<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is stored and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you have actually discovered the journey lever you want eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the correct method. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are prepared to attach your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
