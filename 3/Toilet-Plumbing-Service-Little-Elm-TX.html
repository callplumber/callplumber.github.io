It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
