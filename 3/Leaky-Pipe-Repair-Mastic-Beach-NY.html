<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Mastic Beach NY</h3>
<p>Most houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the external finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
