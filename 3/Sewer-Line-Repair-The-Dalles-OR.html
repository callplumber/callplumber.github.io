<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) once you have actually discovered the journey lever you want eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper way. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are all set to attach your flapper, make sure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
