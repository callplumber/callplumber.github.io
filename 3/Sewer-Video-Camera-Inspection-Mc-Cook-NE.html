<p>Ensuring plumbing equipment such as sprinkler systems and fire pumps are separated to their own particular networks is imperative in order to protect safe and clean water safety. Having a plumbing inspection is pretty standard when buying a house or flat. If it's a leasing I have not seen a plumbing inspection done.  Again I have actually not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In truth, if not done it can be among the most costly repair tasks if ignored. For example, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is a concern, you might need all of your water piping replaced. Once again, really pricey. This is just one of numerous issues that can crop up.</p>
<p>Another responsibility of the Plumbing Division is to carry out cross connection inspections to identify potable water supply that need being safeguarded from contaminates. The cross connection control program is required by the State of Michigan's Safe Drinking Water Act 1976 PA 399.
