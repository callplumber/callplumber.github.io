<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
