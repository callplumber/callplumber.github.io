<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
