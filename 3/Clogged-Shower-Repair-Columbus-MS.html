<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Columbus MS</h3>
<p>A freshly installed hot water heater should not produce unusual sounds, but it will begin to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder over time as the heater runs to warm the water. Things intensify drastically for households with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be required.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be changed. If it is in a garage and a small slow leak, schedule a quote as quickly as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that might be possibly damaged. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
