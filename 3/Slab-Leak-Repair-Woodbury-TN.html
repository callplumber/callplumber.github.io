<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe at Woodbury TN 37190</h3>
<p>If you notice a smell or unpleasant smell coming from your unit, which is not uncommon, consider investing in a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can get away. These flanges are extensively available and simple to install, costing around $30 in your home improvement or hardware stores. Shut off the water system to your house at the main line. To avoid leakages from springing during the installation process, turned off the water supply to your house. Ensure your hot water heater's water supply is turned off, as is the electricity going to the system.</p>
<p>You also need to buy a backflow valve if you observe your water has an unusual flow, color, taste or smell.
