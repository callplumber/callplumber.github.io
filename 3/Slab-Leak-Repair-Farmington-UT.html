<p>Stegle says that when they are working with a client on a custom-made home, they will work straight with the property owner when it pertains to choosing faucets and other components.

<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or momentary connection in between a public water system or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds.
