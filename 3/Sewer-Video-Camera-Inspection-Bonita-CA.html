<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
