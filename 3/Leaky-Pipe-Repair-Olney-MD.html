<p>There are many parts to a toilet that work together to make it operate. There might be a concern with the manage or the lift arm if it is not flushing properly. It might likewise be the flush lever or the flapper. A skilled professional would be able to diagnose which part is stopping working to make the toilet repair right away. Is your hot water heater giving cold instead of warm water? Yikes! It might be something as easy as a blown pilot light or as made complex as a defective thermocouple. Relighting the pilot light could be a Do It Yourself task. Changing the thermocouple or repairing is a task for our team of proficient pros.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might require somewhat different steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover an ideal replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, but opportunities are you'll find among the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
