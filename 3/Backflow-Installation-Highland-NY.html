<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
