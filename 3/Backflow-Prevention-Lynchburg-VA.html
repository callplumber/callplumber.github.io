<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe at Lynchburg VA 24502</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
