<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Huntington Station NY</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>To make placing a toilet much easier, new toilet bolts are extra long. That implies you have to cut off the extending ends later on with a hacksaw. However first connect the water line, flush the toilet a couple of times and look for leakages. If you find any problems, leaving the bolts uncut till you've done these last checks lets you quickly reset the toilet and get rid of.</p>
