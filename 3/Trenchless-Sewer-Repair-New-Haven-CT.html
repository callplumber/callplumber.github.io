<p>As soon as you have actually found the journey lever you want, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Remember that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the appropriate way. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are ready to hook up your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
