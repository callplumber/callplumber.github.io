<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
