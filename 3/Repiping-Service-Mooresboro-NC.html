<h3>Shower Valve Replacement in Mooresboro North Carolina</h2>
<p>Your house's drains and pipes quietly remove thousands of gallons of wastewater from your house every year without you even giving them a second thought. However, when hair, food scraps, feminine health products, toys, and other foreign objects make their method into your drains, they can result in major problems.

If your home is over 50 years old, it's a great bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and a maximum of $15,000. The broad disparity in cost is because of the size of the house, the type of pipe you're installing, and extra repairs you discover you need to make whenever you go behind walls.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair expense might be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the new heater.</p>
