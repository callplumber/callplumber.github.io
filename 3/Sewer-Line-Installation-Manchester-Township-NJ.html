<p>The LAGBC is based upon the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, typically known as "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to obtain consistency amongst the numerous jurisdictions within the State; minimize the structure's energy and water use; lower waste; and decrease the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are easy to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal debris can often get caught in the blades. This can harm the blades and need repairs.</p>

They are really well-informed, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would certainly advise them to my household and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your house.</p>
