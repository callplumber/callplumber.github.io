<p>Whether you need electrical, natural gas, or tankless water heaters, we have the best one for your house. The most popular and conventional style of water heaters in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's neighborhoods is a gas or electrical tank system. These units store simply the right amount of warm water for your benefit. If you are aiming to save more energy and lower your water expense, a tankless water heater would be best since it just heats up water, as you use it not when you don't.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might require somewhat different steps than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To find an ideal replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find one of the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
