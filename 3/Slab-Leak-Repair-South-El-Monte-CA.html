<h3>How to Save Water With Leak Detection Awareness in South El Monte CA 91733</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of removing the clog with negative pressure, it really presses into the clog, working further into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
