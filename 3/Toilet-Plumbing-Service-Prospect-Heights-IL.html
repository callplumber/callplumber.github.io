<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least expensive backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health danger conditions. They should be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just protect versus back siphonage.</p>
