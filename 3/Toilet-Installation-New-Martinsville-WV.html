<p>Hot water heater can be a costly investment for house owners that they deal with for over a years. That's why when it's time to equip your brand-new house or replace your old hot water heater, it is essential to consider the cost, performance, and durability of a new system. Plumbers normally charge $45 to $65 an hour and can usually install a water heater in a day or in 6-8 hours.</p>
