These flanges are easy and extensively offered to install, costing around $30 in the house improvement or hardware stores. Shut off the water system to your house at the main line. To avoid leakages from springing during the installation process, turned off the water supply to your house. Ensure your water heater's water supply is shut off, as is the electricity running to the unit.</p>
