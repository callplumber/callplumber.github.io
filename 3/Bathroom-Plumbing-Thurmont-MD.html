<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Thurmont MD</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>This post aims to deal with the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an effectively set up water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a couple of confusing realities that typically lead people to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is normally destructive. For that reason, softened water must also be corrosive, ideal? This is a fallacy due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
