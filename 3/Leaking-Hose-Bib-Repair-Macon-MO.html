<p>Please let EBMUD know of any circumstance that might require a backflow device. Often conditions on residential or commercial properties change that may need a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with ingredients or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a trouble for your business, they can cause monetary losses and in some instances can stop your organisation completely. For dining establishments having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be devastating. Even in a little office the concerns triggered by even small drain problems can cause significant issues.</p>
<p>The normal option is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, but steel eventually suffers from corrosion and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
