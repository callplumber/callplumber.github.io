<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Ardmore PA 19003</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
