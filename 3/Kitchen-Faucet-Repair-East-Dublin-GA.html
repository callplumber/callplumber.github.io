<p>Finally, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best used in critical locations where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
