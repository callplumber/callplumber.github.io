<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite direction from its regular flow. IRWD's drinkable water supply is designed to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply deviate from "regular," the direction of water circulation can be reversed. This develops a backflow condition and the capacity for infected water going into the drinkable water distribution system.</p>
<p>These branching circulation pipelines form loops and networks including water mains and supply pipelines. Water mains vary in size from 6 inches, to 8, 10, 12, and 16 inches in size. The pipelines offer water for entire communities in addition to big commercial, residential and commercial complexes. Depending on the flow capability, place and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a variety of products: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter enhanced concrete.</p>
