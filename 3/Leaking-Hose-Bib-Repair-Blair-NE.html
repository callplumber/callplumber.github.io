We now have cleaned up and inspected the parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their elements, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line. We are now all set to start the re-assembly process. Some models need the components to be removed in a specific order. These assemblies will likewise need the re-assembly in a specific order. Lots of components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are exposed. As each component is put back into the body, it is important to put them back in the proper location. It is also important that as they are positioned back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the parts or unintentionally positioned in the body. The components need to be positioned so that the guides have the ability to keep their created tolerances.</p>
<p>Building codes can differ from city to city, but all serve the very same purpose.

Adequate drainage should also be offered.</p>
