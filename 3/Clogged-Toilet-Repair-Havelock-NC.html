<p>Since 1980, backflow preventers have actually been legally mandated for particular buildings by the New york city Sanitary Code and the Rules of the City of New York. The policy was not strictly imposed until a push in current years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an effort that consists of routine random inspections of New York City buildings to ensure they are in compliance.</p>
<p>In reality, reverse flow testing developed to make sure that backflow preventers prevent backflow was removed from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow remains a genuine health concern, it considers preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will guarantee that backflow preventers are effectively evaluated by certified personnel.</p>
