Diamond Crystal ® items resolve specific problems such as iron concentration, rust discolorations and sodium content. Unsure whether or not you have a backflow prevention device set up?

When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the option by the sodium ions.</p>

Nevertheless, it is very important to properly keep your disposal. Make certain to run it each day to keep it clear of debris. Constantly run water before and after grinding. Don't push too much waste down the disposal at one time.</p>
