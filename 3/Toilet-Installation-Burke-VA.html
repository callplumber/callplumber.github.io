<p>If you see an odor or unpleasant odor originating from your unit, which is not uncommon, consider buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can get away. These flanges are commonly readily available and simple to install, costing around $30 in the house improvement or hardware shops. Switch off the water system to your house at the main line. To prevent leaks from springing during the installation process, shut off the water supply to your house. Ensure your water heater's water supply is turned off, as is the electrical energy running to the unit.</p>
<p>All you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) when you've discovered the trip lever you desire eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct way. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make certain you've got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
