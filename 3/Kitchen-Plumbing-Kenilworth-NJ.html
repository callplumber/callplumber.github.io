<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
