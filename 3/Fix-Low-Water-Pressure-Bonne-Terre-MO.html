Black iron pipe is, basically, the same thing, but without the zinc covering. The zinc covering on galvanized pipe for gas is indicated to keep the pipe from wearing away from contact with wetness.

<p>A few of the causes of drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a stopping working waste disposal unit, or excessive food being disposed down the drain. We will normally recommend our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting Â® services, depending upon the intensity of the situation. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has actually raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells nasty, or is slow to drain.</p>
