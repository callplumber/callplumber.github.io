If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To find an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before getting rid of the flapper.)

If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
