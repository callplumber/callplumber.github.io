House owners can simply unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the method, water pressure can also be low.</p>

These crystals are microscopic and circulation usually through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require ongoing regeneration.</p>
