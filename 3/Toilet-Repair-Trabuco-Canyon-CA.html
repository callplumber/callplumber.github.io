<p>Most importantly, never plant anything up versus your house, in front of windows, nor near your lateral. (Your lateral is the major line from your home to the city line.) If you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting, you might have an idea of where your lateral is located. If you do not understand, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or perhaps dig into and break the line. If you are working with someone to plant for you, ensure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also understand the locations to avoid. Your line will be easy to determine if you have a clean-out.</p>
