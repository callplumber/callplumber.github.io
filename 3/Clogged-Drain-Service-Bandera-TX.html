<p>Once a large adequate source of water has actually been identified and evaluated, the third significant component of a water system system enters play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its consumers. The biggest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable covering, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Most big cities need a number of aqueducts supplying water from varied and geographically separated sources.</p>
