<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>

<p>A newly installed water heater should not produce unusual noises, however it will begin to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder in time as the heater goes to heat the water. Things aggravate drastically for households with a high need for warm water. The factors for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to bring back normalcy. A hot water heater replacement may be required if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
