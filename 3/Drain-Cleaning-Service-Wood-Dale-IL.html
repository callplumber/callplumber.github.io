<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
