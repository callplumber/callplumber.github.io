Because soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue, the reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term hardness" came from ... it's hard to clean in.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash.

Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
