<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another consultation.

<p>That stated, you don't always need to drain 10s of countless dollars on fixing your home's pipe or sewer lines.

However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately experiences deterioration and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
