<p>Water heaters can be a pricey financial investment for homeowners that they live with for over a years. That's why when it's time to equip your brand-new house or replace your old hot water heater, it is very important to think about the cost, performance, and durability of a new system.

<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET provided by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.

Appropriate care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>

<p>Tankless electric water heaters come in two types. There are whole-house heaters that are large and powerful enough to supply hot water to all bathrooms, kitchens, and home appliances in a home.
