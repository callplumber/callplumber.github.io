<p>Some pipe materials are cheaper than others; some are more prone and brittle to breaking, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other products are prone to deterioration and rust while some are unaffected. Specific pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat strain, making them more susceptible to structural tensions and stress as a result of temperature level change and ice development. And these differences dictate the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
