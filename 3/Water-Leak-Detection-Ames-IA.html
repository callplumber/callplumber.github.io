<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
