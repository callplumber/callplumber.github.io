Bio-Clean is an all-natural solution that's both safe to your plumbing and remarkably efficient at getting rid of grime, waste, and organic material that so frequently clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and just partly repairing the issue. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively seek out natural material and gnaw at it, producing harmless by-products of carbon water, dioxide, and mineral ash, all of which are easily dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are installed in big, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
