Likewise, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
<p>It's Making sounds - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can produce sound. If your energy expenses are increasing, a new, greater efficiency water heater can bring them back down.
