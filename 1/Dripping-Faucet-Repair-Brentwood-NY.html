<p>Water firmness is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term hardness" came from ... it's difficult to clean in.</p>
<p>Changed 50 gallon electrical hot water heater, thermal expansion tank, and pressure regulator valve. When most people consider plumbers, they typically call them for water pipe concerns.

House owners ought to think about whether the plumber has a master plumbing license, which represents a high degree of experience, certifications and understanding.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
