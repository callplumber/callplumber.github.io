<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Summerville GA 30747?</h3>

I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back.

An Angie's list post from March said depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214.
