Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. A lot of big cities need several aqueducts providing water from diverse and geographically separated sources.</p>
