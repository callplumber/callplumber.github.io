<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house. Plumbers can replace or fix blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them functioning properly. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality.
