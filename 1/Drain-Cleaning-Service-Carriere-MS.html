<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, steamfitters, and pipefitters should have the ability to raise and move heavy tools and materials. Idea: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are degrading gradually from the inside. In most cases, repiping is your only feasible option.</p>
