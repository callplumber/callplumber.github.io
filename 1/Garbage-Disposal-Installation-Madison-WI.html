<p>If you see an odor or undesirable smell originating from your unit, which is not unusual, think about buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can escape. These flanges are extensively available and simple to install, costing around $30 in the house enhancement or hardware shops. Shut off the supply of water to your home at the main line.
