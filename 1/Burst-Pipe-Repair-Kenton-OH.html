<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, steamfitters, and pipefitters must have the ability to raise and move heavy tools and materials. Tip: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen up the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are deteriorating slowly from the inside. In many cases, repiping is your only viable option.</p>
