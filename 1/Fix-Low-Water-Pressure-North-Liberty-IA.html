Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might have to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
