<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might have to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange.
