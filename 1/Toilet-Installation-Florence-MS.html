<p>All you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) once you've discovered the trip lever you desire eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the appropriate way. When you've secured the trip lever and are all set to connect your flapper, make certain you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
