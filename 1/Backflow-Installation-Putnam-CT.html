Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get replaced when repiped.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, however if your toilet is clogging more than three times a month, there's a larger problem to examine. You may need to switch toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is reasonably brand-new.
