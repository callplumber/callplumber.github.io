On top of that, you will get a repair estimate and you can negotiate a discount with the sellers to cover the unforeseen costs.</p>
<p>Inspect the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make certain it works. Check below to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of correctly.
