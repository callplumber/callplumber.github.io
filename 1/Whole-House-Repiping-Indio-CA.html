<p>In this situation, filthy water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. If the pipes that need to be fixed run below landscaping or below your house or structure. Hydro jetting uses ingenious technology to send a strong stream of water through your pipes to search the interiors and wipe out persistent blockages. In some cases we use a special camera prior to hydro jetting to target the specific problems inside your pipes.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- essentially two layers of defense. The device enables water to press the check valves open when water is coming into the building, but closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong way. There are 2 various types of testable backflow prevention devices that are commonly specified-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will point out however do not get hung up on them. Because they will be on a certification test, I mention them only.</p>
