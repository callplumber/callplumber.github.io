<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Flat Rock NC 28731</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
