<p>For gas lines that must be run under ground, an unique kind of black pipe must be utilized that is coated with an unique plastic material that keeps the wetness out.

<p>First and foremost, never ever plant anything up against your house, in front of windows, nor near your lateral. (Your lateral is the major line from your home to the city line.)
