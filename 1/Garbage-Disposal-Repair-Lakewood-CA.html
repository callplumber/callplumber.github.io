<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
