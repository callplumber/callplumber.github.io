<p>Dry pipe systems usually are installed in large, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>

Then they are replaced in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
