<h3>Necessity of Sewer Line Inspection in Greenup KY 41144 and Its Procedures</h3>
<p>The most convenient method to keep you and your family safe from the potential risks of backflow through cross connections is to not develop cross connections in the first location. However, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, swimming pool, water feature or other type of cross connection, have an approved backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
