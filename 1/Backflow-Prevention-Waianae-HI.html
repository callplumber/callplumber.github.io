<p>Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a brand-new warm water heater. But in order to reap the benefits of a brand-new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it set up appropriately. A hot water heater that is not set up properly can result in water damage, scalding temperatures, and even a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>In addition to clogged drain repair, you can depend on Waldrop for leaking drain repair. In time, the product your drain is made of can begin to corrode, deteriorate, and eventually fracture with normal use, leading to a leak.

Not only do leaking drains cause water damage, they also result in a big waste of water. A higher-than-normal water bill is typically an indication that you have a plumbing leak somewhere.</p>
<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>

He got our drain cleaned out in a professional and really efficient way. I would not hesitate to call Roto-Rooter for any future requirements.
