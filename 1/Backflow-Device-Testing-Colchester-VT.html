<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have achieved an advancement in water softening treatment utilizing a proprietary Surface Accelerated Condensation (SACr) technology. SACr physically eliminates momentary solidity without using chemicals or high pressure, which are major constraints of present softening technologies.</p>
<p>The water utilized to regrow the softener beads winds up as waste. Other signs that your drain line should be cleaned up include strange smells originating from the drain itself, decreased water pressure from the tap, or overruning water or waste from a sink or toilet.

Many water softeners are hardware on which you can rely.</p>
