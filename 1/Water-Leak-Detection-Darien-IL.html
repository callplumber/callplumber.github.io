<h3>Sink Installation in Darien Illinois</h2>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in locations where water could cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
