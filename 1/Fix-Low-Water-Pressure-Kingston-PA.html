There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure changes and disc compression that might result in false data on the workings of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can cause severe pressure spikes that might damage parts. The effects of elevated temperature level can likewise trigger excessive pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the elements.
