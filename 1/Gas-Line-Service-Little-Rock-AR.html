When pipes burst, hot water heater fail, and toilets clog, the last thing you wish to do is wait through the weekend.

<p>One of the clogged drains services we provide that can clear out drains so any debris inside is eliminated is utilizing high-pressure water jets.

<p>Backflow preventers are likewise required by the plumbing code. Other than within Coastline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities clients is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County). The City of Coastline is the plumbing authority within Coastline's city limitations. Seattle Public Utilities deals with both King County plumbing and the City of Shoreline when it concerns backflow preventer requirements.</p>
<p>Checking the water meter is an excellent next action in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and examine. There is a leak someplace and this could be severe issue if it is. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in your house should have water. This opts for every other shut down valve and their matching faucets. If everything is working effectively, you are off to a good start.</p>
