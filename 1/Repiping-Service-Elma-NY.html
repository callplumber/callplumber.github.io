<p>As constantly, if you smell gas or suspect a gas leak, leave the area instantly on foot. Do NOT use your phone, electric switches, computer system, or anything that might cause a trigger. Go straight to a safe location in a neighboring home or structure, and then call 911 and CenterPoint Energy at 1-800-296-9815 or 612-372-5050 immediately. Position the water softener.

<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural integrity of the system.

Inappropriate installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to discover.</p>
