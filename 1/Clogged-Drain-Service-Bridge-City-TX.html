The actions for replacing a propane water heater are exactly the exact same, and those for an electrical hot water heater are comparable. Recurring leaks and repairs. If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As a result, we suggest changing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>
