<p>Please let EBMUD know of any scenario that might need a backflow device. Sometimes conditions on residential or commercial properties change that may require a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with additives or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than an inconvenience for your company, they can trigger monetary losses and in some circumstances can stop your organisation completely. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be catastrophic. Even in a little workplace the issues triggered by even little drain problems can trigger significant concerns.</p>
<p>A well-designed watering system is essential for the health of plants in a landscape but it's also important for human health. An effective watering system keeps the water for landscapes separate from potable drinking water, preventing contamination that can cause diseases. That's why a backflow preventer is a need on any irrigation project.</p>
