<p>Backflow preventers are critical for producing a safe water supply system. Due to the fact that they're less vulnerable to rust, stainless steel blades are typically chosen. Other good choices are overload defense, which shuts off the motor if it begins to get too hot; an auto-reverse function to avoid jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the dirty dishes get ground up in the disposal.

Scale deposits also build up to plug plumbing components and develop in other home appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, thus impacting their performance.</p>
