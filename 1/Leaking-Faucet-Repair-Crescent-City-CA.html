<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you pick should be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List.
