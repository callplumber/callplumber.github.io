For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from vehicle cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development might stream backwards into the potable water supply.
