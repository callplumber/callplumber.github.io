<p>Water softeners add value to your operation by protecting your water-using equipment from poor efficiency and premature failure. Some difficult water problems are extremely visible, like dispensers and sprayers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go undetected, like scale on water heater aspects and buildup in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Noticeable or unnoticeable, these problems have genuine expenses connected with them. Clogged fixtures trigger replacement or reconditioning costs and can irritate your clients. Scale accumulation in your water heater will inflate your energy costs, and prematurely damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement expenses. Soon, these little expenses can amount to make a genuine effect on your bottom line.</p>
