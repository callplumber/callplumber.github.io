This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Most backflow preventers are created to enable the elements to be removed for repair while the main body remains set up in the piping system.

Knowing the appropriate order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be essential.</p>
