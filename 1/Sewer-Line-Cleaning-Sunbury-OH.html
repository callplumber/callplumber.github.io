<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
