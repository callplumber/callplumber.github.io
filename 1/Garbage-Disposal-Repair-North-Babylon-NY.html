<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide.

If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
