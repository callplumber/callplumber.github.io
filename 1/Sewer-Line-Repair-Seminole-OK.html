Tough water destroys appliances, leaves filmy soap scum throughout kitchen areas and restrooms, and dries hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States relying on tough water for their cooking, cleaning, and bathing, water softeners serve a vital function. A water softener conserves you from changing prematurely destroyed water heaters, flaky faucet heads, and hours and hours of tidying up soapy residue. Purchasing a water softener conserves you time, energy, and cash, and secures your house and your property.</p>

When the piping in your house starts to reveal any of these signs of deterioration, you will inevitably need to repipe the entire plumbing system.</p>
