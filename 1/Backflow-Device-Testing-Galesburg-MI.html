<p>The concern of leak can be credited to any number of elements which can vary from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, in addition to poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank should have some room to account for the growth that takes place. The thermal expansion needs to leave, hence the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. The force applied by the growth taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to break and start leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The treatment for this is to replace the hot water heater system.</p>
