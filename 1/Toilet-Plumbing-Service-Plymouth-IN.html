Homeowners can merely unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can likewise be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the method.</p>

<p>Changing your flapper may require a little different actions than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To discover an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, but chances are you'll locate among the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
