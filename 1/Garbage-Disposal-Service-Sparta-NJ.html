<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the external covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terms prior to we proceed with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly consists of an inlet and outlet shut down, appropriately located test cocks, and the required elements of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet). Each component can even more be broken down into its parts. For instance a very first check belongs. A component can even more be broken down into its individual parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are put together to make elements, and parts are assembled to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
