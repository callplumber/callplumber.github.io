<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
