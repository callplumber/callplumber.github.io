<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by connecting a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank should be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may supply a fast fix in the short-term, it can cause even more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.
