Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in locations subject to water damage. Adequate drainage needs to also be offered.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water system line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it intends directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, examine for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
