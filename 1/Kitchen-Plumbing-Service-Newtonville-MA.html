<p>Hot water heater failures cause countless dollars in water damages every year. Remember that when choosing your new commercial hot water heater, you get what you spend for. While apparently a bargain, a hot water heater ranked for only 7 years is typically likely to fail before you recoup your financial investment.

<p>Depending upon the extent of the clog, we might use a variety of various techniques, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an advanced kind of drain cleaning where we utilize water under high pressure to entirely clean out everything inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and remove the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and eliminate wire adapters. Disconnect garbage disposal wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp port and remove wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
