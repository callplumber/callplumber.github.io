<p>No other room in a home consists of as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. We now have cleaned and examined the components parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their components, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now all set to start the re-assembly procedure. Some designs require the components to be gotten rid of in a specific order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a particular order. Numerous elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are exposed. As each component is put back into the body, it is important to put them back in the appropriate location. It is also essential that as they are put back into the body, that no foreign matter is attached on the elements or inadvertently placed in the body. The components need to be put so that the guides have the ability to keep their created tolerances.</p>
