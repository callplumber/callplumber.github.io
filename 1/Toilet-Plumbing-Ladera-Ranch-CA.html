<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
