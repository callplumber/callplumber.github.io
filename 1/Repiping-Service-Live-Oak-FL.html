<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
