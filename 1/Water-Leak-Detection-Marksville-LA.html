<p>These valves have a lot of versatility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention alternatives, however they also supply the least quantity of protection. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also known as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. When pressurized and drops to enable air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc seals and increases off the air inlet.</p>
<p>Reminder: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I recently had a number of plumbing leakages fixed and couldn't be better with the prompt service I got from Parker and Sons. They are very knowledgeable, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would certainly suggest them to my family and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in the house.</p>

Running a gas line does require either a structure authorization or a plumbing license. For more complex setups and tasks, additional or unique permits may be required. You need to also check the inspections required for your project.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers may be required on a variety of other places in a home or companies either to isolated the residential or commercial property from the general public water system or to obstruct internal backflows in a building's plumbing system.
