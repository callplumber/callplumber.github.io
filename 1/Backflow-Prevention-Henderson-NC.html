<h3>How to Fix a Leaky Faucet from the Kitchen in Henderson NC 27537</h3>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>

Roto-Rooter Â® Drain and Grease Trap Treatment is an environmentally-friendly solution to ongoing drain maintenance. This item is pumped into your drain lines on a pre-programmed schedule, cutting buildup and keeping correct drain circulation. The treatment even helps reduce smells!
