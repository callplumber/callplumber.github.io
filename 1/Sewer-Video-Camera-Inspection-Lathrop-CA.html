<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
