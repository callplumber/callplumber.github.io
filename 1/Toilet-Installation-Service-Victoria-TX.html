<p>Your house's drains and pipes silently eliminate thousands of gallons of wastewater from your home every year without you even providing a doubt. Nevertheless, when hair, food scraps, feminine health products, toys, and other foreign items make their way into your drains, they can result in major problems. While in some cases it's apparent you need drain cleaning (when your bathroom sink is totally stopped-up, or there's gurgling in your kitchen drains, for example), it can sometimes be more difficult to inform if you have an issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can position problems.</p>
