<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
