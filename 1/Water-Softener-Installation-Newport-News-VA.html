It probably goes without stating that leaking pipes should be changed right away. It may be regular to have condensation on hot water pipes, however it's absolutely not normal for your pipes to spring a leak.</p>
<p>Tough water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
