A Baffle - A sink baffle sits in the sink flange and helps smother the sound of the disposal system. It also stops large things from going into the disposal unit and prevents up sprinkling when the system is on.</p>

Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they stay in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>
