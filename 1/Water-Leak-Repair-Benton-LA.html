When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health danger if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, in addition to examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
