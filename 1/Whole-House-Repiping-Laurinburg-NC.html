<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>When you've found the trip lever you want, all you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Remember that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right way. When you've secured the journey lever and are all set to attach your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
