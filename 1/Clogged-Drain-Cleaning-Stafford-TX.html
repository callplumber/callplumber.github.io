<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Stafford TX</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Another way to handle a clog is by utilizing a chemical cleaning item or if you fear they may be too harsh on your pipes, you can attempt old home remedies like warm water, vinegar, and baking soda.

<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the blockage with negative pressure, it in fact pushes into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
