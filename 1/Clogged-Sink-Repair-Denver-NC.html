<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If enabled to return to the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for efficiency, as well as checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
