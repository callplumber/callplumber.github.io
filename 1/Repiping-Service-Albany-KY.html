<p>Deterioration: The most typical problem is corrosion in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater. This is especially true if you have unattended tough water, which contains harsh minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material gradually. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is causing the corrosion, you will ultimately experience a leak in your water heater that is hard to repair. Leaks frequently indicate a brand-new unit replacement is in order.</p>
