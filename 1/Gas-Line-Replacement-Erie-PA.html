<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program safeguards the general public water supply from contaminants and impurities that could, under specific scenarios, be drawn into the general public water system from private properties. If you need a new toilet, the cost largely depends upon the toilet you select. Toilets vary in style, flushing efficiency and bowl shape, all of which make some toilets more costly than others. When installing a new toilet, the plumber may also need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the task.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there might be a fracture in the porcelain, either the toilet or the tank bowl itself. Horseshoe Bay guidelines require that watering systems which do not inject chemicals should have their backflow preventer checked upon installation and after that every 5 years later.
