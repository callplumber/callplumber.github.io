Worn out and rusted parts make repairs challenging and pricey, indicating a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the correct fix for problems such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little parts of the whole fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
<p>You depend on your drains to carry wastewater from your tub, sink or shower. In time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more.
