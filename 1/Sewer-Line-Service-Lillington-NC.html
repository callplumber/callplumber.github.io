<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can create sound. If your energy costs are rising, a brand-new, higher efficiency water heater can bring them back down. All that needs to be done is closing off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, allowing difficult water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its new location and placed there.</p>
<p>Pro Suggestion: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the very best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; recover the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
