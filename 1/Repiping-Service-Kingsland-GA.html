<p>Plastic pipe is in broad use for domestic supply of water and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become useful to produce till 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe began to be made in the 1940s and remained in large usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The technique for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have actually ended up being increasingly common, with a range of fittings and products used.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of your home, repiping may take anywhere from a couple of days to a week. Typically, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires complete water turned off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience very little interruption to your daily routine. To start the repiping procedure, the plumbing team will initially cover any carpet and furniture to protect them from dust and debris. They will then make small cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and after that remove and replace them, leaving as much of the initial structure product as possible intact.</p>
