A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in private homes, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and infecting the public water supply.</p>

<p>Downsides to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
