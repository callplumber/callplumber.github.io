<p>As a locally-owned business, stability and responsibility are exceptionally important to developing a track record for quality. Keep in mind: The disposer outlet should be above the drain line coming out of the wall.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
