<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
