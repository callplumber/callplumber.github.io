<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
