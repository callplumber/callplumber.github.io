<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No warm water in your home? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these problems, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement.

In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to decrease any scale growth or rust.
