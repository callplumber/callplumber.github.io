Drain blockages are triggered by wear and tear or an accumulation of things we put down the drain over time and as we know, they can cause serious plumbing problems.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas.
