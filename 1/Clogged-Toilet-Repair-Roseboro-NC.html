<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or permanent connection in between a public water system or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances.

<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is devoid of hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
