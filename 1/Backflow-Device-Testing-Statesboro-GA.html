<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners eliminate calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Basically, soft water conserves you money. Minimized Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the very first check valve.</p>
<p>A Pilot Light That Has Gone Out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you utilize a gas water heater rather than a system with an electric heating component, there is a great chance your pilot light has headed out. This could be because of a problem with your thermocouple, an absence of flammable air, or simply a strong breeze. Despite what the problem is, nevertheless, your water heater will not be able to work until the pilot light is re-lit.</p>
