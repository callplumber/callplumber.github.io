Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.
