<p>The secret to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby removing hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>In reality, reverse flow testing created to ensure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was gotten rid of from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow remains a legitimate health issue, it thinks about preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are properly tested by certified personnel.</p>
