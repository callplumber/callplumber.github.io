<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. When it comes to your home's plumbing and home appliances, difficult water is a result of mineral develop up as well as one of the most significant problems. Using our Salt Free System will extend the life of your household devices by reversing the damaging effects of deterioration.

<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to avoid backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>

<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the safe and clean water supply and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be set up. An authorized, properly installed and kept backflow assembly essentially gets rid of the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Ensure that the softener is filled with salt or potassium chloride following the maker's recommendations.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>There are more than 17,000 backflow prevention assemblies on water services in our service area. The California Department of Health Services requires each of these assemblies to be checked annually. This testing is done by backflow assembly testers authorized by the Orange County Healthcare Agency. A list of the certified testers is available online.
