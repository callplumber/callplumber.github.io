<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it must be much less water.</p>

<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mainly time associated. If whatever is prepared, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be customized, changed, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and for that reason the overall costs. The majority of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor expenses roughly $150.</p>
