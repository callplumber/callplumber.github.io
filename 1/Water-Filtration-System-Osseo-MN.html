<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
