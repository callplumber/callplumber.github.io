<h3>How to Do Home Plumbing Inspection Yourself at Fennville MI 49408</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are considered a health danger if backflows happen from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be suggested on construction plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a water fountain or garden pond should be evaluated upon installation and then yearly.</p>
