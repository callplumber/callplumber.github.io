<p>Water heater failures trigger countless dollars in water damages every year. Bear in mind that when picking your brand-new commercial hot water heater, you get what you pay for. While relatively a bargain, a water heater ranked for only 7 years is frequently most likely to stop working before you recoup your investment.
