<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Service in Ferndale</h2>

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in areas where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
