For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from automobile cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may get in the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may stream backwards into the safe and clean water system.
