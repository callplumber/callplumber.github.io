<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Sewer lines have one crucial function: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the issue worsened. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a really pricey alternative.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal lasts an average of 10 to 12 years. This average life-span estimation presumes normal wear and tear of the unit.
