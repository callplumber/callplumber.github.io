Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it.

As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return due to the fact that he had another appointment.
