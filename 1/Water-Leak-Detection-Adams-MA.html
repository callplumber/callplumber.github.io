<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
