Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
