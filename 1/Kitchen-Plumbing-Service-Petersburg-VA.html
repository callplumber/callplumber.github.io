<p>Repairing a faucet or sink itself is frequently a matter of clearing a clogged drain However, after over thirty years of repairing every make and design of sink and faucet in the Triangle or Sandhills, we can state that there are many more common problems. Bell Cow is your reliable local plumber and sink repair specialist-- from fast repairs to structural repair, we do it all.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<p>This article aims to attend to the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: a properly set up water softener does not make the treated water more destructive.

Therefore, softened water must also be corrosive, ideal?
