<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is very low.

With time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes.

If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
