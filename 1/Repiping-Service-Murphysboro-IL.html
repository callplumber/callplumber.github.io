<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe in Murphysboro IL 62966</h3>
<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically sodium or often potassium).</p>
