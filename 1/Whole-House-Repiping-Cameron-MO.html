Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>Many homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the external finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
