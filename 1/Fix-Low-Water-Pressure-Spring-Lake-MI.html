<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they deteriorate over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to various types of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from corrosion and may put toxins into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your home. This might not require completely repiping your house, because more recent materials might have already been utilized in some sections, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you pinpoint precisely what work requires to be done.</p>
