<p>Picture living in a home with soft water-- a home where you don't have odd films on your dishes or mirrors, can lather soap easily, and do not need to stress over scaling on the inside or outside of your devices. Sounds great, doesn't it? What if we told you that you could do all of that with a tankless, saltless water softener? Well, with NuvoH2O environmentally friendly water supply for houses, you can.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by utilities or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
