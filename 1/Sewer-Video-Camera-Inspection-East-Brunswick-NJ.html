<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
