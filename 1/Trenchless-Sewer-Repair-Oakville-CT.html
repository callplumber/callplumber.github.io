<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it intends directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
