Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of garbage disposal, nevertheless, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal particles can often get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>
<p>Deterioration: The most typical problem is rust in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater.
