<h3>Laundry Room Plumbing in Scotts Valley California</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have attained a breakthrough in water softening treatment utilizing an exclusive Surface area Accelerated Crystallization (SACr) technology. SACr physically gets rid of momentary firmness without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are significant restrictions of existing softening innovations.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
<p>We've already seen what these two terms share, so what's the distinction in between them? When it pertains to the issue of tough water, a standard water softener actually gets rid of calcium, silica and magnesium ions, leaving it with little quantities of what is called short-term hardness". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
