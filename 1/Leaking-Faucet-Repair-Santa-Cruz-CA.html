<p>Rust: The most common issue is rust in the tank and pipes that link to your water heater. This is especially true if you have without treatment hard water, which contains severe minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another element that is triggering the corrosion, you will eventually experience a leak in your water heater that is difficult to repair. Leaks frequently imply a brand-new unit replacement is in order.</p>
<p>Difficult water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the option by the sodium ions.</p>

Monthly water costs will enhance as well, and you can expect to need couple of to no repairs for leakages and blockages during the next few years. With correct maintenance, your re-piping will last for numerous generations.</p>
