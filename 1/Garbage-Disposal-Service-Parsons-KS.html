We now have actually cleaned and inspected the parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their elements, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now all set to begin the re-assembly procedure. Some designs require the parts to be gotten rid of in a particular order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a specific order. Numerous components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each part is returned into the body, it is necessary to put them back in the proper place. It is likewise essential that as they are placed back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the parts or accidentally positioned in the body. The components must be positioned so that the guides have the ability to maintain their designed tolerances.</p>
<p>Prior to selection and installation, refer to makers literature for temperature ranges.
