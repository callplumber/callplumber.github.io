<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Junction City KS</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be replaced. If it is in a garage and a little sluggish leak, schedule an estimate as soon as possible and guarantee nothing is near the heater that could be possibly damaged. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
