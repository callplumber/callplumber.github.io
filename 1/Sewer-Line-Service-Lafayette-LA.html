<p>It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an appropriately operating RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations based on water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be offered.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
