<h3>How To Save Water In An Emergency Plumbing Flood Inverness FL</h3>

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin.
