<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
