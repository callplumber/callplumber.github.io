Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
