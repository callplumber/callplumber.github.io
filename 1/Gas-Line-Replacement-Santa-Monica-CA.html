<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
