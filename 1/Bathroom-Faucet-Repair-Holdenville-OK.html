<p>2 designs of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of a separately acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. A PVB might be used to isolate health or non-health risks but works versus back-siphonage just.</p>

<p>Are your plumbing pipes starting to show indications of wear? We can repipe your entire pipe system, or repair certain sections in your house or workplace the very same day.
