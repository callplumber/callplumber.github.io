<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes broken or clogged, it might wreak undesirable concerns on your home. A house's service line (also called a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the homeowner is accountable for preserving the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Once in some time, every toilet clogs. How frequently a toilet clogs depends upon the strength of its flush, the cleanliness of its drain pipes, and what it's trying to flush.
