<h3>Woodward OK 73801 Experts In Unclogging Drains</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>

This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
