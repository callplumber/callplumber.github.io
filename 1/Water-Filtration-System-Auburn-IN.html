<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
