<p>When compared to gas models, electric models are easier and less expensive to install as electrical power is currently offered through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line needs to be installed and a viable source of gas developed. Another feature of an electrical hot water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated effectively utilizing vents and ducts in order to function correctly. With electrical designs, you will not need to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
