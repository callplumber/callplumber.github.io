<p>The majority of homeowners have conventional water heaters that feature a tank where warm water is kept. While these are cost-efficient at first buy, they are not the most reliable or effective method for you to get hot water, especially if your system is obsoleted.

<p>In truth, reverse circulation testing designed to guarantee that backflow preventers avoid backflow was removed from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow remains a genuine health issue, it considers avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will make sure that backflow preventers are properly tested by qualified personnel.</p>
