<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, enabling air to go into the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>

<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical solution, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>

Our waste disposal unit repair professionals can diagnose any issue that may occur with your system, and we can help you choose in between repair and replacement.
