<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if required. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You may have to increase or reduce the vent size to make sure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced. If it is in a garage and a little sluggish leak, schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and make sure absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be possibly harmed.
