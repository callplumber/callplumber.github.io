<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Castle Hayne NC 28429</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
