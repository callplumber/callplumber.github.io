<h3>What To Do First When I Need An Emergency Plumber Near Me Smithville TN</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health threat if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for efficiency, in addition to inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>

Many fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Normally, this operating system is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  No matter the operating mechanism, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>
