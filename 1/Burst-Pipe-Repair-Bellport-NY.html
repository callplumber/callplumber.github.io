<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Bellport NY</h3>

When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health threat if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, as well as checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
