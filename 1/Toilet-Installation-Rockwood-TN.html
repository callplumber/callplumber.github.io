<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic system from your house. When you experience obstructions in numerous drains simultaneously in your home, then that typically suggests that your main sewer line is supporting. This can happen in numerous areas and any mix of drains. For instance, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this kind of backup.
