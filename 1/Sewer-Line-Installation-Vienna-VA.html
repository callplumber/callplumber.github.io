<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Vienna VA 22182?</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (normally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
