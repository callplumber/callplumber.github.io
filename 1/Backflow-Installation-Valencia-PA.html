<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, but if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to analyze. If your toilet is reasonably brand-new, you may need to switch toilet tissue or hire a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can look up your state's licensing details.

Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no other way to offer one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is set up.

However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does happen more frequently than you think! Often it happens during the night when you don't discover the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes construction jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems.

An appropriately fixed assembly should supply years of protection.</p>
