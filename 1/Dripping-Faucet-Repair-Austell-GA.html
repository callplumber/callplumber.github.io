<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it actually presses into the obstruction, working further into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily.
