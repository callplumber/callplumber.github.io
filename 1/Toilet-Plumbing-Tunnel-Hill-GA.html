<p>The majority of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the external finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
