However, when hair, food scraps, feminine health products, toys, and other foreign objects make their way into your drains, they can result in major problems. While sometimes it's obvious you need drain cleaning (when your bathroom sink is entirely stopped-up, or there's gurgling in your kitchen drains, for example), it can in some cases be more difficult to inform if you have a concern on your hands.</p>
<p>Checking the water meter is a terrific next action in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and inspect.
