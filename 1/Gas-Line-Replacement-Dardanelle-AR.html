<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your water heater installation appointment. Installing natural gas lines can bring a new level of service. As tough water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water adhere to the beads, and the treated water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Discovering slow-draining water in your sink or tub? Clogged drains and plumbing blockages are a typical problem with an easy professional option.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
