Then, a brand-new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is attached to its mount. In this approach, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
