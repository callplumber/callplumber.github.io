<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Marshall NC</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems need the assistance of a professional. Some small blockages can be taken care of with a plunger and frequently, when the toilet won't stop running, it's a simple matter of replacing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. However, specific concerns do call for an experienced plumber, and it is very important to understand the difference to avoid wasted frustration, time, and money.</p>
