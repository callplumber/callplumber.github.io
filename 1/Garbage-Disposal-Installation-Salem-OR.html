<p>Finally, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline.

Such models are convenient if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
