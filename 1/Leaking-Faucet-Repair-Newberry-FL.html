It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on really slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
