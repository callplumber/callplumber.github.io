Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
