<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Leakages- Don't spend for hot water you're not taking pleasure in! Our plumbers will locate any leaks and appropriately seal them. 4 - The regeneration option (CO2-enriched water) flows from the regeneration storage tank (4) to the exchanger filter.
