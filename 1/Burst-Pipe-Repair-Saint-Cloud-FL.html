<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather defense. As the external finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
