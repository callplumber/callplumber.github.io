<p>The issue of leakage can be credited to any variety of factors which can vary from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance. The water heater tank ought to have some room to account for the expansion that takes place when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to escape, hence the need for a growth tank to help manage the pressure. The force applied by the growth taking place when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to break and start leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The solution for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
