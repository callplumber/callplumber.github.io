<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some houses were enabled to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the home.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.
