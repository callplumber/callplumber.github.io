In an unprotected water service connection, potable water can stream both in and out of a building or component. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a building for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water backwards into the water supply. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from vehicle washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray advancement might flow in reverse into the drinkable water system.

<p>Finally, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best utilized in crucial locations where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
