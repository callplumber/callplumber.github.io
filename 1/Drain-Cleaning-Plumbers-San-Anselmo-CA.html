<p>Backflow preventers are important for producing a safe supply of water system. Because they're less susceptible to rust, stainless steel blades are typically preferred. Other excellent alternatives are overload protection, which shuts off the motor if it starts to overheat; an auto-reverse feature to avoid jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the dirty dishes get ground up in the disposal. And if your house is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal specifically created to be utilized with a septic tank. gives a summary 1 of garbage disposals and septic systems.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a major public health threat if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of illness or disease.</p>
