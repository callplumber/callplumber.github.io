<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back due to the fact that he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>
