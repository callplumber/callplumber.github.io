<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are considered a health risk if backflows happen from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area should be suggested on building and construction strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond must be evaluated upon installation and then annually.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
