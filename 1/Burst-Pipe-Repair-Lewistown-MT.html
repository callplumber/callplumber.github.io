<p>Instead of drudging large trenches to access your underground sewer system, Roto-Rooter specialists will drill simply a couple of holes to see where the sewer line problem is and resolve it quickly. Call Roto-Rooter today to see if trenchless sewer line repairs are the best choice for your home or business. The other difference between constant feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals just squash the food in batches (for this reason the name)-- not simultaneously like a continuous feed garbage disposal.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can result in improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
