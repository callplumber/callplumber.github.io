<p>Leakages are sly. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
