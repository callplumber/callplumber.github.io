Call Roto-Rooter today to see if trenchless sewer line repairs are the ideal choice for your house or business.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
