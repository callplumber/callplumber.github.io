<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
