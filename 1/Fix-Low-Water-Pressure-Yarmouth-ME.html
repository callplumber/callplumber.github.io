<p>Thank you a lot for taking the effort to repair our water softener. over the vacations. We had been on vacation during the time of repair and it was reassuring to understand it had actually been taken care of and all set to go upon our return. For a plumber focusing on drain-clearing services, anticipate to pay at least $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. Many problems can be repaired in an hour. For weekend or night calls, include more to the hourly rate.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure.

That way, you won't be fixing the same disposal two weeks later on.</p>
