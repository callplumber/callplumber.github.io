<p>Tankless electric water heaters come in two types. There are whole-house heaters that are effective and large enough to supply warm water to all bathrooms, cooking areas, and devices in a house. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electrical heaters that provide warm water to particular spaces or devices only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the very same way. The only distinction is the quantity of water they can heat up at any given time. Also, whole-house units are considerably more costly than the point of usage systems.</p>
