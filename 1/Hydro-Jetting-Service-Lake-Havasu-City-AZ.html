<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Lake Havasu City AZ</h3>
<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather defense. As the external coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Seeing high water pressure at plumbing components in your home? Water pressure in the home is similar to blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure causes damage to the plumbing system, this can cause emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator installed is FAR MORE cost-effective than mold remediation or changing flooring or drywall! So we suggest repairing or setting up water pressure regulators to protect your entire house.</p>
