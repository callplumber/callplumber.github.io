These cameras are created to go through twists and turns due to their bend, and their real-time transmission provides definitive proof of the issue. However, for drain line inspections, a plumbing camera will have trouble going around a p-pipe drain. Please contact The Pipe Doctor if you have any concerns.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
