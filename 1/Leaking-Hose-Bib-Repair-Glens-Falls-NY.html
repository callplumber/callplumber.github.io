<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is undamaged and tight, without any signs of leak, you can probably leave it in location. Chances are great that the installing brackets on the brand-new unit will fit just fine. To discover, get rid of the old disposal and install the brand-new flange on it. You can install the brand-new disposal utilizing the old flange if it fits.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
