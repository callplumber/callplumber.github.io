We have 300% more chemicals that surpass national health standards, and a even high percentage of contaminants in our water that the nationwide average. On top of that our average water hardness level is in between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simplicity factors "really hard water".</p>

<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Lincolnshire IL</h3>
<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if needed. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>If you have a big bathtub or more that two restrooms, this design hot water heater might make one of the most sense for you. There are some installation factors to consider, especially around sizing the gas line and installing the flue vent, however with the ability for a 50-gallon tank to produce more warm water than a standard 80-gallon tank, these things are quite special. High-efficiency storage is an excellent option for space heating hydronic alternatives too.</p>
