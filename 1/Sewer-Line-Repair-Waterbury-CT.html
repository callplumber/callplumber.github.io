<p>Leaks are sneaky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Market prices for house water softeners might vary from around $400 to $2,700, depending on the size and kind of softener. Softeners are rated by the overall number of grains the system can remove before being charged. The cost of salt is around $5 to $8 per 40-pound bag of sodium chloride (NaCl), depending upon the form acquired, and up to $25 per 40-pound bag for potassium chloride (KCl).</p>

<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
