Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another visit.
