<p>Many homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the external coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>Testing should be completed by a contractor signed up with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor must possess a legitimate, updated plumbing license, existing insurance coverage, backflow preventer testing accreditation, and presently calibrated test kit. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>
