<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, dishwasher, and boiler, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these small deposits are harmless, however over time they build up and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably limit the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>While waste disposal unit work terrific for breaking down light food residue, they are not designed to handle large quantities of waste. Sometimes, a metal object, such as an utensil, coin, or staple , can jam a disposal.
