<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the service with firmness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to confess water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is devoid of solidity ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
