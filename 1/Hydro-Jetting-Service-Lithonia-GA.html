<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
