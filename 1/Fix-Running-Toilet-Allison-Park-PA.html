<p>Plastic pipe is in wide use for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to manufacture up until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed an approach to plasticize PVC, making it much easier to process. PVC pipe started to be made in the 1940s and remained in wide use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The approach for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have ended up being significantly typical, with a variety of fittings and materials used.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of years, however steel ultimately experiences rust and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
