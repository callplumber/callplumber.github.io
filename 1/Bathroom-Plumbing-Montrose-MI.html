Usually, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or in between $130 and $310 to have professional repairs done by a plumber. The per hour charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not include materials or parts. Costs depend upon the exact repair needed, where you live, hiring a plumber vs. hiring a handyman, and whether you can DIY it.</p>
<p>Next, examine the body. Depending upon the size and producer, the bodies can be made from bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again crucial for the repair service technician to be knowledgeable about the solidity of the products so that their cleaning procedure is not devastating. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to reduce any scale growth or corrosion. It is very important that the repair service technician is delicate to the firmness and type of the different finishes utilized on iron body units so as not to damage the protective finishing.</p>
