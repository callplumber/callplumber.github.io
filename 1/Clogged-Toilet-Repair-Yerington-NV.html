<p>You depend on your drains to carry wastewater from your tub, shower or sink. Over time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products gather in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them difficult to remove.

<p>Backflow preventers are likewise needed by the plumbing code. Except within Coastline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities customers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County). The City of Coastline is the plumbing authority within Shoreline's city limits. When it comes to backflow preventer requirements, Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Shoreline.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also enable options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
