<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
