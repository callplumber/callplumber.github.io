<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters must be able to raise and move heavy tools and products. Tip: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen up the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are weakening gradually from the inside. Most of the times, repiping is your only feasible alternative.</p>
