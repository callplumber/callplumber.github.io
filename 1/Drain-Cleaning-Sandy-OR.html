<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement in Sandy OR 97055</h3>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based upon polymer type active ingredients such as salt polycarboxylate.
