<p>High water pressure also results in thermal expansion in water heaters which can cause possible water damage if the hot water heater leaks or burst. The more of these components you have, the more costly the job will be.

Replacing the pipes for lots of plumbing components requires more labor and pipe, which increases cost.</p>
<p>It doesn't always imply they need to be replaced if your pipes are older than these standards. Well-kept pipes may last longer, and badly kept ones or those in areas with difficult water (suggesting it has high mineral content), might stop working sooner, states Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the lifespan estimates.</p>

<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any circumstance that might need a backflow device.
