<p>A water softener eliminates minerals that create water firmness, among the most typical water quality problems a homeowner encounters. Difficult water ruins appliances, leaves cloudy soap scum throughout kitchen areas and restrooms, and dries hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States counting on tough water for their cleaning, bathing, and cooking, water softeners serve a crucial purpose. A water softener saves you from replacing too soon messed up water heaters, flaky faucet heads, and hours and hours of cleaning up soapy residue. Investing in a water softener conserves you time, money, and energy, and secures your home and your property.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
<p>You'll understand how crucial it is to routinely repair and keep your water heater if you have ever been shocked by cold water in the shower.
