<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Sedalia MO</h3>

Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
