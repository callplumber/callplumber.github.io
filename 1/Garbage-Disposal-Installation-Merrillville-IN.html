<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
