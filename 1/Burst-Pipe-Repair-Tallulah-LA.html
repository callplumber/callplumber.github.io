<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
