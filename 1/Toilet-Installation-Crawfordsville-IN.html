<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Crawfordsville IN 47933?</h3>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it ought to be much less water.</p>
