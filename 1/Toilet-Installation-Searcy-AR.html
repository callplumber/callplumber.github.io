Tip: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen up the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are weakening slowly from the inside. For the most part, repiping is your only feasible alternative.</p>
