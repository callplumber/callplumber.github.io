In time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes.

If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
