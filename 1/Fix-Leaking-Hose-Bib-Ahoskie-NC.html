Don't be confused by the labels FIP and MIP; they just represent female pipe threads and male pipe threads, respectively. And when you buy the parts, don't think twice to request for assistance. Then screw all the gas line parts together to make certain they fit.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to employ a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair bill might remain in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the new heater.</p>
