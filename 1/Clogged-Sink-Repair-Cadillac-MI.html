<p>Leaks are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>To link a power cable to the new unit, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their counterparts in the cord, utilizing wire nuts.

<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is.
