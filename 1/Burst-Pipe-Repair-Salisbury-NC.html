<p>Many homes or structures that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition defense. As the external covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
