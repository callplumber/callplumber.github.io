<p>Oregon state laws governing water supply require backflow prevention assemblies to be set up on water services where cross connections can not be removed. Backflow assemblies are needed to be installed on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems. The law likewise needs backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as healthcare facilities and mortuaries, as well as commercial facilities.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
