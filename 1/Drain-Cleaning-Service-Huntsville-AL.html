<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Huntsville AL</h3>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you select need to be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed must have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to prevent backflow. The basic ways of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
