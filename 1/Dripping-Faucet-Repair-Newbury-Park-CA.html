Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure.

There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure variations and disc compression that could result in false data on the operations of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can cause extreme pressure spikes that could harm elements. The results of raised temperature level can also cause excessive pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the elements.

The new parts can soon be made inoperative if parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not remedied.</p>
