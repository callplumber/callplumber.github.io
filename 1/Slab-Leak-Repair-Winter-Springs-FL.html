<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are long lasting in the short-term, they deteriorate over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to various kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to compromise from rust and may put toxins into the freshwater supply. We suggest replacing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your home. This might not require totally repiping your home, since more recent materials might have currently been used in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you determine exactly what work needs to be done.</p>
