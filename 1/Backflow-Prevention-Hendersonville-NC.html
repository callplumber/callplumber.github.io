<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
<p>Installing the new drain is a simple matter: First, develop a snake out of plumber's putty and circle the drain from the top. Then install the leading half of the drain from the top, and screw the nut and mounting bracket on from beneath. Make sure to remove any excess plumber's putty utilizing a putty knife. I recently had to replace the hot water heater in my house and it was just 6 years of ages. Conventional hot water heater with a tank need to normally last 10 to 15 years. I also have a dishwasher in my kitchen that has not been utilized in more than two years. Washing meals is my least favorite chore, especially without the help of a dishwasher.</p>
