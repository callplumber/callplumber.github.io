<p>Your disposer may include a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as laid out below. Both will create an excellent seal (though the gasket might result in percentages of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is mainly a matter of choice. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most obvious signs of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your house.
