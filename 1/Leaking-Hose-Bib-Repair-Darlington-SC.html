If you are presently experiencing any flooding on your property when it rains, then there is a likelihood that the storm drain is clogged and therefore needs to be cleaned out. If a clogged storm drain is not attended to in a timely manner, the chances are high that it will trigger additional damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>
