<p>This, again, is because of the minerals present in the water you are utilizing to clean them with. With soft water, you don't have that issue because it lacks the minerals that are in tough water.

<h3>Water Heaters & Water Filtering in Lewes Delaware</h2>
<p>Without a water softener, laundry demands extra detergent to avoid it from looking dingy. Dishes will come out of your dishwasher stained and streaked.

<p>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of treatment when it comes to drains.
