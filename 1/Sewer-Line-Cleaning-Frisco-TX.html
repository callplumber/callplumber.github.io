<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractors in Frisco</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Leaks are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
