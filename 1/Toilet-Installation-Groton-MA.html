<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Groton MA 01450?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
