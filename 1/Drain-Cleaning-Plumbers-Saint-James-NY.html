<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>It's not a necessity, but a garbage disposal will make life in your Chicago area house simpler.
