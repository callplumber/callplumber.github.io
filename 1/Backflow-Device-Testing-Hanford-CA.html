<p>All you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you've found the trip lever you desire eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper method. When you've secured the trip lever and are all set to link your flapper, make sure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
