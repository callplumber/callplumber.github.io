<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe.

It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
