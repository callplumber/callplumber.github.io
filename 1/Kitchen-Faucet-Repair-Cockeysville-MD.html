<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
