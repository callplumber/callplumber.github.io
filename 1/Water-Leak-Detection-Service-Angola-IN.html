<p>Leakages are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
