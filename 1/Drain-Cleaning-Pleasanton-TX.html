<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, however it does take place regularly than you believe! When you don't discover the water was off for a couple of minutes, typically it takes place at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a new pipe. This makes building projects quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
