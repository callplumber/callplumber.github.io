<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Do you need to have your house's plumbing system took a look at? It is very vital that you have a professional team of gas pipe installers perform an emergency gas line repair or replacement for gas leakages in your house or commercial area. We suggest getting your home or workplace inspected for gas leakages every year, or the minute you believe that a leak has taken place. A gas leak can lead to a fire, and even a surge, or trigger physical tension on the body that leads to headaches, fatigue, lightheadedness, irritation to eyes and throat, chest discomforts, ringing in the ears, nosebleeds, and more. In fact, Carbon monoxide gas poisoning is a common result of without treatment gas line repair tasks. Beyond bodily harm, gas line leakages can also trigger severe damage to your pipes, meaning more of your hard-earned cash spent on repairs.</p>
<p>Another obligation of the Plumbing Division is to carry out cross connection inspections to identify safe and clean water systems that are in need of being secured from contaminates. The cross connection control program is required by the State of Michigan's Safe Drinking Water Act 1976 PA 399. A-Tex Plumbing will aid with any kind of emergency toilet repair, drain cleaning or replacement that you might need in your house or office.</p>
