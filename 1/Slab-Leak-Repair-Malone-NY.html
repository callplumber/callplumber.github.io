<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are installed in areas where water could cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for effectiveness, in addition to checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
