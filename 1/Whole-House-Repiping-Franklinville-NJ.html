<h3>Recent Advances in Sewer Drain Cleaning Technology at Franklinville NJ 08322</h3>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a destructive result on your service. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more tear and wear than residential sewers and are more vulnerable to obstructions and blockage. All backflow preventers should be evaluated every year by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report must be provided to us.</p>
