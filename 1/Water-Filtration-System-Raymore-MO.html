<p>While you can look up internet tutorials on garbage disposal installation, the plumbers at J. Blanton Plumbing are qualified and licensed, and we can ensure your disposal will be installed properly and work exactly as it should. If you desire to add one to your kitchen sink for benefit, provide us a call today. The cost to install a disposal will depend upon the kind of disposal unit you buy, whether you need to replace an old disposal or install a completely brand-new system, and any additional electric or plumbing work needed.

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair expense may remain in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the new heater.</p>
