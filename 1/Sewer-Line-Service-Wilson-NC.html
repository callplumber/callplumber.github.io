<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Wilson NC</h3>
<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
