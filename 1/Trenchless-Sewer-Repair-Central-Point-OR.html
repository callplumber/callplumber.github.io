<p>Please let EBMUD know of any scenario that may need a backflow device. Sometimes conditions on properties change that might need a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with additives or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a hassle for your service, they can cause monetary losses and in some circumstances can stop your organisation totally. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be devastating. Even in a small workplace the issues caused by even little drain problems can cause major problems.</p>
<p>The typical service is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
