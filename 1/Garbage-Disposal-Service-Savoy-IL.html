<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
