WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
