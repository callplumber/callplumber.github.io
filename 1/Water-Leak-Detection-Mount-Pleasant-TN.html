<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
