<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Sandy UT 84092</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
