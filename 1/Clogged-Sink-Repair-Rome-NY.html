<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
