Irrigation backflow prevention assemblies should be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to make sure proper backflow prevention is in place to safeguard our drinking water throughout the watering season.

Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no way to supply one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up.
