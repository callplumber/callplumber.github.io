Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each component. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities.

In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
