<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Leeds AL</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>That is an indicator the tank is failing and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. Schedule a price quote as soon as possible and guarantee absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be possibly harmed if it is in a garage and a little sluggish leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
