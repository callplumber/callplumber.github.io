<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Somers Point NJ 08244</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

<p>Fragrance Release - Sink flanges are offered for around $30 that seals the top of the unit to avoid smells. Ensure that the plumbing throughout the home is prepared for freezing weather by having pipes covered. The vents throughout the house should be the type that can be closed off in the winter season time during durations of intense cold. For homes with wells, the well must be secured in some fashion from bitter cold too.</p>
<p>You can utilize a wire coat wall mount by correcting it if you don't have a plumber's snake. Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some clogs. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
