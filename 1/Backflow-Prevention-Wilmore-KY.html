It is again important for the repair service technician to be knowledgeable about the firmness of the products so that their cleaning process is not destructive. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to lessen any scale development or rust.

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler generally are set up in areas where water might cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

After that the softener can be disconnected, relocated to its new area and placed there.</p>
