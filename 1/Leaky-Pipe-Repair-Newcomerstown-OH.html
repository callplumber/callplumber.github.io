<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
