That drip-drip-drip noise from your sink can be bothersome, however it's more than just a problem. Leaky faucets can hurt your house and your wallet, triggering serious water damage and leaving you with high water costs.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

<p>It's an oddly complicated scientific process, but easy to correct. It uses salt to eliminate minerals and odors found in difficult water- most commonly calcium and magnesium.

Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
