<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Evans GA 30809?</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is simply recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally sodium or often potassium).</p>
