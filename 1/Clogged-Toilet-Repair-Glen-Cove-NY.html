<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and combined with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>

<p>While a DIY toilet replacement is certainly possible, it's also easy to screw up. And when you mess up a toilet installation, you can wind up with big problems: Leakages, messed up floorings, wetness in floor substructures and walls-- serious and costly issues. Unless you're extremely knowledgeable, it's best to trust a professional for changing a toilet.</p>
<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mostly time related. If whatever is all set, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours needed and therefore the overall costs. Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
