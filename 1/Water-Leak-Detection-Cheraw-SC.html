<h3>How to Get the Best and Fastest Sewer Cleaning Service at Cheraw SC 29520</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>

<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your house. When you experience obstructions in several drains simultaneously in your home, then that usually indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in multiple areas and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of mixes of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
