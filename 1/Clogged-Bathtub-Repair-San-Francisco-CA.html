If there is a leak, one thing to know about gas lines is they can be incredibly harmful. While gas leakages are unusual, you need to get out of the structure right away if you see an odor like rotten eggs in your property.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
