<h3>Blocked Drains in Hodgenville KY 42748 - Various Tools Used</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
