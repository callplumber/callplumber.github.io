<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, it is crucial that the system and garbage disposal plumbing remain in excellent working order to avoid kitchen drain clogs or backups.

In time, dirt, debris, hair, and countless other small particles can get trapped and build up in your pipes. Ultimately, the water may not be able to drain quickly or effectively, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is continuously backing up.
