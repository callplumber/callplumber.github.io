<p>Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the potable water supply within a structure these devices are known as isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no other way to provide one, then we inspect to see that the correct BFP device is installed.

We will usually recommend our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting Â® services, depending upon the severity of the circumstance. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling sounds, smells foul, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
