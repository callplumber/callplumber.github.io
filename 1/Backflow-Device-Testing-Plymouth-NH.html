In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in homes were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Constant clogs: If the plunger has actually become a routine component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous blockages show your toilet no longer has the power needed to effectively eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
<p>Repiping a house takes three to five days with an average cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending on house's size and the company doing the work.
