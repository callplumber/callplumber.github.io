<p>Our plumber teams intend to keep your house and work locations effective, comfy and practical. Another indication your disposal requires replacement would be strange noises. If your disposal is regularly making sounds that are unusual for the machine, it might be in need of major repairs or it could be nearing completion of its life expectancy.

It is probably due to too much usage over a long duration of time if there are leakages coming from your system. Much of these leaks can be repaired, but if they become larger and more frequent, you should consider total system replacement.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
