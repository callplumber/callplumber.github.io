<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Palmetto GA</h3>
<p>You can relax and utilize your gas piping without any concern when we handle your gas or gas pipe installation and gas pipe repair. While water overuse is a problem for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth procedure. That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
