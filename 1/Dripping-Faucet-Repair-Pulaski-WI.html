<p>You can likewise depend on water softeners to minimize your everyday operating costs by conserving cleaning agent and allowing you to utilize lower water temperatures while keeping a premium wash. Water solidity, measured by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, varies throughout the U.S. from slightly difficult (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
