<p>Leaks are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain.
