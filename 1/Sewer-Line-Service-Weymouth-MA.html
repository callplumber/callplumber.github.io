<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Weymouth MA 02188?</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
