<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services New Bedford MA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a practical option, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
