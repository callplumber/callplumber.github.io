<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and blended with water. , if you plan to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration instantly begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regeneration generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
