Conventional water heaters feature a tank of stored water that is fueled by gas or electrical power.

<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and get rid of water particles from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without solidity ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
