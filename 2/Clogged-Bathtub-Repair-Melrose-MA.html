<p>When compared to gas designs, electric models are simpler and less expensive to install as electrical energy is already offered through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be set up and a viable source of gas established. Another function of an electric water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas designs need to be ventilated effectively using vents and ducts in order to function correctly. With electric designs, you will not need to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
<p>Installing a new gas line in the kitchen will typically vary from $300 to $800 depending upon the length of the pipe needed. If you're transforming your home to gas, or if the current line is at capability, anticipate to invest $2,000 or more. New gas line costs include home appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
