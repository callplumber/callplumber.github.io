<p>Our plumber teams aim to keep your house and work locations effective, comfy and functional. Another sign your disposal needs replacement would be odd sounds. It might be in need of major repairs or it might be nearing the end of its lifespan if your disposal is regularly making sounds that are abnormal for the machine. Frequent blockages, even when you're barely washing down any food particles, could indicate a problem with the disposal. If there are leaks originating from your system, it is most likely due to too much usage over a long period of time. A lot of these leakages can be fixed, but if they end up being bigger and more frequent, you must consider total system replacement.</p>
