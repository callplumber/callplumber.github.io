<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow instructions within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the office number listed on the structure permit. Inspections need to be made after foundation excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to concealing work), and upon completion.

<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Audubon NJ</h3>
<p>Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on really gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to ensure no valves were accidentally exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
