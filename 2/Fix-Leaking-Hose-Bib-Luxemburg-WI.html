<h3>Leaking Faucet in Luxemburg Wisconsin</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have actually achieved an advancement in water softening treatment using a proprietary Surface Accelerated Crystallization (SACr) innovation. SACr physically gets rid of temporary firmness without using chemicals or high pressure, which are major constraints of existing softening innovations.</p>
<p>Regrettably, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically becomes destructive.

If it is one of the pointed out issues, a repair or replacement of the elements might be enough. However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems taking place frequently, then a water heater replacement is essential.</p>
