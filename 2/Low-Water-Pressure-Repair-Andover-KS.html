<p>Leaks are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water.

WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
