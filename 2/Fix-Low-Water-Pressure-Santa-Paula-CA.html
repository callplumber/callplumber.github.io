<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
