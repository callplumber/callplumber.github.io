<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally regrow after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
