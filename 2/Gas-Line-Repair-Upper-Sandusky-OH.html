<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Upper Sandusky OH 43351</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
