<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is among the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health threat conditions. They must be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It needs to also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>

The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is free of hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
