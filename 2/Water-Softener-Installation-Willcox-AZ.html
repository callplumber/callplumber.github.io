<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair at Willcox AZ 85643</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
