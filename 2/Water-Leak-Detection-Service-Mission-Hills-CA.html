<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Mission Hills CA</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
