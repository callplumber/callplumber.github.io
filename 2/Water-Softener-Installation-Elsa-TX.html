When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated effectively. It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is split. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed over time.

A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely cracked and simply needs to be changed.</p>
