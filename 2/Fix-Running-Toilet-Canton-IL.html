I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
