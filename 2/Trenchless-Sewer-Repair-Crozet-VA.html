<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous decades, but steel eventually suffers from corrosion and lacks the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
