<p>Leaks are tricky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
