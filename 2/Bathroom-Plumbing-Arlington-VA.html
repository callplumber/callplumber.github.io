A backflow preventer is a device designed to keep water inside fire-protection and other water-based systems on a property-- guaranteeing it only travels in one direction: from the water pipe into the system's pipes.</p>

Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
