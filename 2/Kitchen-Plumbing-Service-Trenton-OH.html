<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.

Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
