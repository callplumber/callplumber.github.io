<h3>Clogged Tub in Lake Stevens Washington</h2>
<p>If you're living with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless appliance repair costs, you need a water softener. Difficult water is not an issue that will go away on its own and the costs incurred by difficult water will just continue to intensify. With a water softener, appliances will undoubtedly fail quicker than their expected life-span. Your flow rate will continue to limit and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout the home if scale continues to build up in your pipes. Difficult water ravages water heaters, and without a softener, your energy costs will continue to barrel skyward. If your water supply is hard, the continuous cycle of repairs and replacements will continue up until your home is secured by a water softener.</p>
<p>You could conserve over 1,200 gallons of water each month with a new toilet! If you're replacing an old toilet to enhance water efficiency or replace a broken toilet, we can assist. Call us today to schedule an installation service call. Residences with water wells: Residence on well water should have an RP backflow preventer on their service line separating the general public water supply from the home.
