This device consists of no less than five individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close.
