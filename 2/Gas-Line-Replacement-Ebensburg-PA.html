This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
