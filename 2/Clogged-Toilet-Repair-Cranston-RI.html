<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>We've already seen what these two terms have in common, so what's the difference in between them? When it comes to the concern of hard water, a traditional water softener in fact gets rid of magnesium, silica and calcium ions, leaving it with small quantities of what is known as short-lived solidity". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
