I recently had numerous plumbing leakages fixed and could not be happier with the prompt service I received from Parker and Sons. They are very educated, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would absolutely suggest them to my family and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be found near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Warning: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Just because copper is showing does not indicate you do not have polybutylene pipes. You may have to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>A properly designed watering system is very important for the health of plants in a landscape however it's also important for human health. A successful watering system keeps the water for landscapes separate from potable drinking water, preventing contamination that can trigger health problems. That's why a backflow preventer is a necessity on any irrigation project.</p>
