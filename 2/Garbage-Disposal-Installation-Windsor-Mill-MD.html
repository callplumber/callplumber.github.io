<p>Once you have actually found the trip lever you desire, all you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the right method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
