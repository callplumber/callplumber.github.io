<p>The program achieves its objective by offering the adoption and promulgation of suitable rules and policies for the building and construction of plumbing facilities where mandated.

Trees and shrubs are a common cause of sewer blockages to the home. Roots can become the smallest fracture or space in your house's drain pipe, where they thrive in the nutrient abundant environment offered by the sewer.</p>
<p>To connect a power cable to the new system, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cable, utilizing wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing plans are not needed for one- and two-family dwellings or townhouses, as specified in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>

The softener changes these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
