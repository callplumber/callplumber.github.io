<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your hot water heater installation consultation. Setting up gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service. As hard water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause hard water adhere to the beads, and the cured water heads out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
