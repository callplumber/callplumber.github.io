The LADBS application need to be filed and spent for a minimum of 2 (2) organisation days prior to the date of the event, AND, after you have actually obtained all other required approvals or clearances from all other agencies. Garbage disposals can be made from either aluminum or stainless-steel. Aluminum is less expensive however more vulnerable to leaking and rust. Stainless steel blades are likewise more long lasting.

<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
