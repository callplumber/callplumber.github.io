<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than removing the obstruction with negative pressure, it actually presses into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal installation needs to be performed by a professional plumber if you desire it to work well for many years to come.

<p>A water softener is composed of a mineral tank and a backflush tank. It collects hardness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are often used for water softening. When an ion exchanger is obtained water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as salt or potassium.
