<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
