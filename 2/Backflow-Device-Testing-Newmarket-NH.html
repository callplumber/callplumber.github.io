<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water system line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, examine for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
