Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
