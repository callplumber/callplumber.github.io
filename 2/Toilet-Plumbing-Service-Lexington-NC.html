<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<p>Garbage disposal clogged or broken? Whether you need repairs or replacement, we've got you covered in the Cincinnati area. Waste disposal unit are developed to operate in one of two ways. Either through what's called a batch feed, where the unit is filled, then covered prior to it is switched on, or through a constant feed, where the system can be filled while it is running.</p>
<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can produce sound. If your energy costs are increasing, a new, higher efficiency hot water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, allowing difficult water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, transferred to its brand-new area and placed there.</p>
<p>If you notice that your waste disposal unit has unexpectedly stopped working, you can call us! If you turn the switch to trigger your waste disposal unit but all you hear is a hollow sound or no sound at all, you might have a clogged or broken  waste disposal unit. Luckily, you can call the technicians at Cooper's Plumbing & Air for quick garbage disposal repair, in addition to all your kitchen plumbing needs.</p>
