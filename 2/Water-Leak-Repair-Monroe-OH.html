<p>In truth, reverse flow testing developed to ensure that backflow preventers prevent backflow was gotten rid of from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow stays a genuine health concern, it considers avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are properly evaluated by certified workers.</p>
<p>A review of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly must then be evaluated. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure variations and disc compression that might cause false information on the operations of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can result in extreme pressure spikes that could damage parts. The effects of elevated temperature level can also cause excessive pressure conditions which could damage the parts in the components. These and other negative effects from the hydraulic conditions must be acknowledged and their cause corrected. If parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not fixed, the new parts can soon be made inoperative.</p>
