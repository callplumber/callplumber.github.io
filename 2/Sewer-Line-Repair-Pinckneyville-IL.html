The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and benefit back siphonage only for non-health risk or health risk conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not enable the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just protect against back siphonage.</p>
