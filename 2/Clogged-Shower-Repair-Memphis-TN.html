<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>

The contractor must have a legitimate, current plumbing license, existing insurance, backflow preventer testing certification, and presently calibrated test kit.
