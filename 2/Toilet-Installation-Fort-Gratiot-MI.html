<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and turn the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
