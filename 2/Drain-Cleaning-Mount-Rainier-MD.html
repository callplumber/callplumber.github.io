<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
