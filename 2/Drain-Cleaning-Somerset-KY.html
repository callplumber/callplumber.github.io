It must also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not enable the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just secure versus back siphonage.</p>
