These devices are frequently combined into single products to increase their efficiency, such as check valve assemblies (consisting of two consecutive independent check valves (DCVA)) and Reverse-pressure concept backflow preventers (two inline check valves with a pressure relief valve located in between them to dump out any backflow water (RPD)).</p>
