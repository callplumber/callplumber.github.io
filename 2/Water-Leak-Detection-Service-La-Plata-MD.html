<p>Seattle Public Utilities inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be evaluated by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report must be provided to us. Get cleaner clothing, get rid of rust spots, and use less detergent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house models are appropriate for washing devices, or you can attempt laundry additive water softening products.</p>
<p>DCVs are specifically developed to prevent backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The mainstay for typical fire protection applications, DCVs include an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, two independently running spring-loaded check valves (normally inside a single valve body), 4 test cocks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals start around $500-$ 2,500 and go up depending upon size, brand and functions.</p>
