If it only occurs with warm water, you will likely need to replace your warm water heater. If you're like many homeowners, you probably do not understand what type of pipes you have.

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low.

Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
