A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
