<p>In this situation, dirty water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. If the pipes that need to be repaired run below landscaping or underneath your home or structure.

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi).
