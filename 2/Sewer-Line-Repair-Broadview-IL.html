<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each component. If the part is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
