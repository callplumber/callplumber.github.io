<h3>Residential 24 Hour Emergency Plumber Near Me Sparta WI</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains.

The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
