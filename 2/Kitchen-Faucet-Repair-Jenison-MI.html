<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and on-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
