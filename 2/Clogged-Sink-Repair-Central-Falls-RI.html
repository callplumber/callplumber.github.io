<p>A leaky waste disposal unit can be repaired if you can locate the part that's causing the problem. Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners exchange the mineral ions of calcium and magnesium with salt or potassium. By lowering the mineral content, the system prevents scaling. The exchanged ions are then flushed out of your drain. Toilet service, like toilet repair, is something that everyone tends to delay up until it is an emergency. However, there is absolutely nothing that can ruin your days like an out-of-service, leaking toilet or overruning toilet. With our free estimates, there isn't any reason not to call when your toilet starts revealing signs of leaking.</p>
