<p>If you have a garbage disposal, it is vital that the unit and waste disposal unit plumbing remain in great working order to prevent kitchen drain blockages or backups. Garbage disposals can be damaged if non-food things like flatware, sponges, or straws end up in the device. Garbage disposal blockages can be caused by food products like fats or grease, bones, or highly fibrous foods like celery.</p>
<p>As we stated, a garbage disposal has a life expectancy. Typically they will last in between 10 and twelve years. So, if you discover any of the following indications when you have had your disposal for about this amount of time, then you are right about ready for a brand-new one.
