<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible solution, especially when easy plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>
