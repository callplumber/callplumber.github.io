In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in houses were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Constant blockages: If the plunger has actually become a regular component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous clogs suggest your toilet no longer has actually the power required to efficiently remove waste with each flush.</p>

Service lines which stem from private property and feed into the main line are a common area for leakages or breaks.
