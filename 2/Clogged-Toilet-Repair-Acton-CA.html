<p>When compared to gas models, electric models are much easier and less expensive to install as electrical power is currently offered through the main power supply line. For gas hot water heater, a specific gas line needs to be set up and a practical source of gas established. Another feature of an electrical water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated appropriately using vents and ducts in order to work properly. With electrical designs, you will not have to install any new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
<p>You also need to purchase a backflow valve if you discover your water has an unusual flow, color, odor or taste. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other problems in your home's plumbing system. More complex concerns with water temperature level or pressure may need changing the hot water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
