<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in West Point MS 39773!</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
