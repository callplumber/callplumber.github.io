In buildings other than Group R-3 occupancies, a permit and inspection will be required for more substantial work if more than 10-percent (small) of a floor level, wing, or area is included, even though the floor level, wing, or area defines less than 10-percent (nominal) of the overall structure plumbing.</p>
<p>Before installing, your professional will turn off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a new mounting ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is hooked up to its mount. In this method, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get sped up.</p>
