<p>When compared to gas designs, electric models are simpler and cheaper to install as electrical energy is currently readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line has to be set up and a viable source of gas developed. Another feature of an electric hot water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated properly utilizing vents and ducts in order to function correctly. With electric models, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
<p>Reminder: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure.
