<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your hot water heater installation visit. Setting up gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service. As hard water passes through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger hard water stick to the beads, and the treated water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
