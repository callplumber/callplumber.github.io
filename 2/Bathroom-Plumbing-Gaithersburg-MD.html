Throughout regrowth, salty water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
