<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
