If you have had plumbing service prior to planting, you might have a concept of where your lateral lies. If you do not know, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or perhaps dig into and break the line. If you are working with somebody to plant for you, make sure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that he or she will also understand the areas to prevent. If you have a clean-out, your line will be simple to determine.</p>
