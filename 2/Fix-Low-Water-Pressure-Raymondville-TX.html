<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible option, especially when simple plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and family.</p>
