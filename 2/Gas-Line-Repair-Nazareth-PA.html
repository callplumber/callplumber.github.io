The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for effectiveness, along with checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>

So, the greater per capita usage" of water in backwoods might consist of substantial non-revenue water losses from their circulation pipelines. Such issues likewise factor into the need for backflow preventers at the points of usage.</p>
