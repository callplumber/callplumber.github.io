<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Garden City MI 48135</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
