<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Beaufort SC 29906</h3>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is simply capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
