<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and meet our rigid trust accreditation requirements. A good general rule is to replace faucets that reveal rust, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and wore away parts make repairs difficult and costly, meaning a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the appropriate fix for concerns such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
