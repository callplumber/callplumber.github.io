However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
