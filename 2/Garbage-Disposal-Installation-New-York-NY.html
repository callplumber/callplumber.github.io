I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214.
