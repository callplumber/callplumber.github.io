<p>There are certain plumbers who concentrate on plumbing associated with home remodeling and new construction. When a new house is developed, pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be installed correctly and to local, state, and federal code.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
