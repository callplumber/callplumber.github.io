Then find and watch the numbers on your home's water meter. If the numbers increase after 20-30 minutes, you have a leak. And the faster those numbers increase, the bigger the leak.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to work with a plumber for that burner package. The total repair costs may be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800).
