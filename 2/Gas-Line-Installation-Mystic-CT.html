<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does happen more often than you believe! Frequently it takes place at night when you don't discover the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants.

The majority of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
