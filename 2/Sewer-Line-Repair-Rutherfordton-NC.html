<p>No other room in a home consists of as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. We now have cleaned up and examined the parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their parts, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now all set to start the re-assembly process. Some models require the elements to be gotten rid of in a specific order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a particular order. Numerous parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are exposed. As each part is returned into the body, it is very important to put them back in the correct location. It is likewise essential that as they are put back into the body, that no foreign matter is attached on the parts or accidentally put in the body. The elements need to be put so that the guides are able to preserve their designed tolerances.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>If you're coping with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and unlimited appliance repair bills, you need a water softener. Hard water is not a problem that will disappear on its own and the costs incurred by difficult water will just continue to escalate.
