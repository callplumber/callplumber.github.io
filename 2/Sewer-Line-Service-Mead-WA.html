<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Mead WA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
