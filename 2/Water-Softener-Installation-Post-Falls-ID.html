<p>Dry pipe systems usually are installed in large, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
