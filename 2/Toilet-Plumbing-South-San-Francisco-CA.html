<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, usually regrow after numerous gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
