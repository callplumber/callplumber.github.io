When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
