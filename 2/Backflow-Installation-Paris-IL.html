<p>Prior to selection and installation, refer to manufacturers literature for temperature level varieties. All assemblies should be secured from freezing temperatures and if set up where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a warm water type assembly should be used. Consult producers requirements for suggestions. When searching for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your requirements and ask prospects if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the advanced experience and licenses associated with a plumbing contractor.</p>

<p>A water softener removes minerals that create water firmness, one of the most common water quality problems a house owner encounters. Tough water damages home appliances, leaves cloudy soap scum throughout cooking areas and bathrooms, and dries out hair and skin.

A water softener saves you from replacing prematurely destroyed water heaters, flaky faucet heads, and hours and hours of cleaning up soapy residue. Investing in a water softener conserves you time, energy, and money, and secures your house and your property.</p>
<p>The Custom-made Select mixing valve allows you to change the firmness of the water so you can have your water, your method.
