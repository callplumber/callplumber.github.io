For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from vehicle cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might enter the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development might flow in reverse into the potable water supply.

Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close.
