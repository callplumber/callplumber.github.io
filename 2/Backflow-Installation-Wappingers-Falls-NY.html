<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

Suggestion: Place a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal.
