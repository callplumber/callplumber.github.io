<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Wheeling WV</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
