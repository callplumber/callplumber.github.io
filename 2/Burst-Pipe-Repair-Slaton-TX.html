<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than removing the clog with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the obstruction, working further into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean.

Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
