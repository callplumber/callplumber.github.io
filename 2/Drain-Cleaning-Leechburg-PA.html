<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The service technician, Kenny, was polite, professional and helpful! He asked me to take a look at the camera with him then explained my alternatives without trying to oversell me!
