Connect the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the mounting ring to the flange from underneath the sink. Ensure you snap the backup ring in place.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in many cases it ought to be much less water.</p>

In many cases, we replace the damaged component to prevent leaking or corrosion.
