The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health hazard or health hazard conditions. They should be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must likewise be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just secure versus back siphonage.</p>
