<p>If your pipes are older than these guidelines, it does not necessarily mean they need to be replaced. Well-maintained pipes may last longer, and poorly preserved ones or those in areas with hard water (indicating it has high mineral content), might fail faster, says Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the life expectancy estimates.</p>
<p>Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water solidity can be gotten rid of fairly quickly by using an ion exchange treatment. Standard water softeners are cation exchange gadgets. Cations describe positively charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion. Master plumbers will not charge for their services grossly excessive rates, or otherwise take excessive advantage of an unsuspecting public.</p>
