<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water system line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
