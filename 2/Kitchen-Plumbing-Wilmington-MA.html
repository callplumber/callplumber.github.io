<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that must also be well kept to assist prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to crack and solidify or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>

However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
