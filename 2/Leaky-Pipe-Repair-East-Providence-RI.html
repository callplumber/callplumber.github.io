However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of.

That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
