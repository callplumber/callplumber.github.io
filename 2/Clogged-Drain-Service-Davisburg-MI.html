<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very important part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
