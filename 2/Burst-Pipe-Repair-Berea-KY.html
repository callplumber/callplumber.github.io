Hard water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your utility bills will continue to barrel skyward. If your supply of water is hard, the continuous cycle of repairs and replacements will continue until your house is protected by a water softener.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If permitted to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, in addition to examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
