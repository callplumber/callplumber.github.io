<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
