<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your house. Then that typically implies that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience clogs in multiple drains at once in your home. This can occur in numerous areas and any mix of drains. For instance, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
