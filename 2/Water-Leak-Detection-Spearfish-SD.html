<p>When the water softening does not take place it could also show softener malfunction, or an issue with the salt that is used. At home shops, many Badger 5 disposals can be acquired for about $99-150. With Bill Howe's additional guarantee, with installation, clients are taking a look at roughly $325. The Development Series and other high horse power heavy-duty disposals with peaceful functions generally start at $300 and up simply for the disposal.</p>
