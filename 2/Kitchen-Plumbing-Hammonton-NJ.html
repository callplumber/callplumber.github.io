<p>Spotty dishes? Some underground gutter drains terminate in the sewer system instead of at the edge of your yard. In that case, measure from the downspout to the nearby manhole, and use an auger line at least that long to ensure you're cleaning the whole pipe. A garbage disposal will last 10 to 12-years, and many guarantees cover the very first 2 to 5-years. When acquiring a new unit, keep this in mind.</p>
