<p>Sewer lines have one crucial role: bring wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the issue became worse. Waiting just wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a really expensive alternative.</p>
