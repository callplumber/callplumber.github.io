<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each element.
