The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in diameter to offer appropriate circulation.</p>
<p>The anode rod in your water heater is developed to draw in corrosion-causing components in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from wearing away.

If you look at your home's plumbing pipes and see stains, discoloration, flaking, little imprints or rust, your pipes are wearing away.
