However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
