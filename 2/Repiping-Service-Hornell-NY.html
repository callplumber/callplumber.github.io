<h3>Reduce The Cost Of Hiring A Plumber Hornell NY</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed. If it is in a garage and a small sluggish leak, schedule a price quote as soon as possible and make sure absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be potentially harmed. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
