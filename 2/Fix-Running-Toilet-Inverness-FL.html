It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
