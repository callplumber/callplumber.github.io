If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To discover an ideal replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.)

If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
