<p>If you're living with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and unlimited home appliance repair expenses, you need a water softener. Difficult water is not an issue that will go away on its own and the expenses incurred by difficult water will just continue to intensify.

Your flow rate will continue to restrict and you risk losing water pressure throughout the home if scale continues to build up in your pipes. Hard water ravages water heaters, and without a softener, your utility bills will continue to barrel skyward. If your water supply is hard, the perpetual cycle of replacements and repairs will continue till your house is protected by a water softener.</p>
