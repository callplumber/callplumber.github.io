<p>As soon as the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
