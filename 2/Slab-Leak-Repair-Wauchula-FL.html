Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
