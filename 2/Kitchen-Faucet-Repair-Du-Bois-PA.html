<h3>Lavatory Faucet Replacement in Du Bois Pennsylvania</h2>

Lye is created to eat through clogs and dissolve them, but it likewise eats through your pipes and develops weak points that are susceptible to rupture.</p>
<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural stability of the system.
