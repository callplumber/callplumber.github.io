<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back due to the fact that he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
