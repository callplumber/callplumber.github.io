<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off.

The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
