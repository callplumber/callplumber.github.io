<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back due to the fact that he had another visit.

<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements.

The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each component. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
