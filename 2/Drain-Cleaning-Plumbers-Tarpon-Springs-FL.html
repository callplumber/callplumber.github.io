<p>The concern of leak can be attributed to any variety of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, as well as poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank must have some room to account for the growth that takes location. The thermal growth needs to get away, for this reason the need for an expansion tank to help control the pressure. The force exerted by the growth taking location when boiling the water triggers the tank to split and start leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The treatment for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
