<p>Mounted under the sink, the waste disposal unit is indicated for chopping up small bits of waste food. When turned on the motor impellers and spins-- also called lugs-- throw littles food against a mill ring. You need to always run water while using the waste disposal unit; once the garbage disposal does its task, the water flushes the finely chopped particles down the drain.</p>

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
