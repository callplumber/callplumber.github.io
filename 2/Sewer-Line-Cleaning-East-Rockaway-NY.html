<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a couple of things worth understanding about waste disposal unit installation. Typically, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or in between $130 and $310 to have professional repairs done by a plumber. The per hour charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not consist of materials or parts. Costs depend upon the specific repair required, where you live, working with a plumber vs. working with a handyman, and whether you can DIY it.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system.
