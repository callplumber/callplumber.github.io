<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.
