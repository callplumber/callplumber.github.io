<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
