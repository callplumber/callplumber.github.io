<p>All you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) when you've discovered the journey lever you desire remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the correct way.
