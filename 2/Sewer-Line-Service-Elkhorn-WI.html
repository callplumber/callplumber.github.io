<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You may be acquainted with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the very same thing, however without the zinc covering.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
