For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
