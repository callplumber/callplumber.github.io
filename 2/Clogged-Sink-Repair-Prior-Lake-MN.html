There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure changes and disc compression that might result in false information on the workings of the backflow prevention assembly.

The impacts of elevated temperature level can also trigger extreme pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the components. These and other negative effects from the hydraulic conditions should be recognized and their cause corrected. The new parts can quickly be made inoperative if parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not fixed.</p>
