<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>The concern of leakage can be attributed to any number of aspects which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank ought to have some room to account for the growth that takes place.
