<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they weaken over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to various kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to weaken from deterioration and might put toxins into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your home.
