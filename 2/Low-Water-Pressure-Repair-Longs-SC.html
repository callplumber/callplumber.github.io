<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some softeners deal with electricity, however some more recent water softeners use waterpower. Costs of a water softener considerably depend upon the type of water softener and the kind of energy that is used, however also upon the hardness of the water that needs softening and the water use. When the water is really difficult and it is used greatly, the costs of softening will rise.</p>
