Over time, sinks can likewise get dings, chips and scratches that can ruin their visual appeal. Gauges in porcelain sinks can begin to rust.

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
