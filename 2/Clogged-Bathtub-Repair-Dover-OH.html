<p>Many house owners will see a clog and instantly grab a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner.

Lye is created to eat through clogs and dissolve them, however it also eats through your pipes and creates weak points that are vulnerable to rupture.</p>
<p>No house owner wants to deal with dysfunctional plumbing, specifically when it can cost thousands in repairs. Your homes plumbing exceeds simply the pipes inside your house to the main sewer line that connects to them. Most significant plumbing problems normally happen on the main line, and it's best to prevent them as much as possible. Damaged sewer lines can lead to bathrooms flooded with sewage, busted pipes, and expensive repairs.</p>
<p>A lot of demand for plumbers will stem from new construction and the need to repair and keep plumbing systems in existing houses and other structures. Employment of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to embrace modifications to building codes that require using fire suppression systems.

If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in place-- start by eliminating the old drain. Many drains are attached to the sink by a big nut below the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>
