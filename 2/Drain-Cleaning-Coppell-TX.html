<p>You'll have to replace it if your old disposal is broken beyond repair. Although any broken appliance is frustrating to deal with, fortunately is that setting up a replacement disposal will be less expensive than setting up a brand-new waste disposal unit in a sink that has never had one in the past. Depending upon the pro you deal with, it can be as much as half the rate.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are set up in large, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
