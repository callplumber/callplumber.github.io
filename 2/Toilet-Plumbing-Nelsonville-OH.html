<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, however steel ultimately experiences deterioration and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
