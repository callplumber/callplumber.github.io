<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Howell MI</h3>
<p>A freshly set up hot water heater should not produce odd noises, but it will start to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder with time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things get worse significantly for households with a high need for hot water.

If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be necessary.</p>
