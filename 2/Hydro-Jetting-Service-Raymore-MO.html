<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- normally salt. The outcome is water that's been efficiently softened by removing almost all traces of the minerals that constitute tough water.</p>

<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, steamfitters, and pipefitters must have the ability to lift and move heavy tools and products. Idea: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are deteriorating slowly from the inside. In many cases, repiping is your only practical option.</p>

Pumps push tough water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
