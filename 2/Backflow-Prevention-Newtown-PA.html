When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
