<p>Downsides to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well.

Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
