<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, but steel eventually struggles with rust and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
