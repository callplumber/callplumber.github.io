<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if needed.

You may need to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a feasible service, particularly when basic plunging does not seem to work.

<p>Seattle Public Utilities inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies.

Whole-house models are appropriate for washing makers, or you can try laundry additive water softening items.</p>
