<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

Programs normally last four to 5 years and require apprentices to complete a certain number of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>
