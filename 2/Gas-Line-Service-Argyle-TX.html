<h3>Discover The World Of Faucets For Improved Water Conservation Argyle TX</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Lots of people are reluctant to use water softening systems since they may be under the impression that the equipment regrows rather frequently and puts a high load of salt salts into the drainage. This, obviously, is not true; the average family of 4 people would require whole house water softener regrowth approximately two or three times a week.</p>
