Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>Dry pipe systems generally are set up in large, unheated areas, such as parking lot.
