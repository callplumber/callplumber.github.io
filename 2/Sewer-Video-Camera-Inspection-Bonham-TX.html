<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractor in Bonham</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is among the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being damaged or clogged, it might wreak unwanted concerns on your residential or commercial property. A house's service line (likewise called a sewer lateral) ranges from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the homeowner is accountable for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health hazard if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of illness or disease.</p>
