<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Nampa ID</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your backyard. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images caught by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>That is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it is in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule a quote as quickly as possible and guarantee nothing is near the heater that might be potentially harmed. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
