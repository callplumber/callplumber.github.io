<p>Tough water stops washing cleaning agents and cosmetic cleansers from working as effectively. When washing products are used in tough water - difficult water ions bond with surfactants making them not available to bond with water.

<p>All you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) when you have actually found the journey lever you desire eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the appropriate way. When you've secured the trip lever and are ready to link your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
