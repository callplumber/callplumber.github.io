<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
