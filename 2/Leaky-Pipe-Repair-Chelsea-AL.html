It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is stored and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).

No matter what the problem is, however, your hot water heater will not have the ability to function until the pilot burner is re-lit.</p>
