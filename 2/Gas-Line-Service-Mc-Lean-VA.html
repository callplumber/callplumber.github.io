Once again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In fact, if not done it can be among the most costly repair jobs if neglected. For example, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is a concern, you may need all of your water piping changed. Once again, extremely costly.

Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly flow towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream might cause a turnaround in circulation.</p>
