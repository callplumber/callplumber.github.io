<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each component. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
