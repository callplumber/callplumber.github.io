<p>If you notice a smell or undesirable odor originating from your unit, which is not unusual, think about buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can leave. These flanges are commonly available and simple to install, costing around $30 in the house improvement or hardware shops. Turn off the water supply to your house at the main line.

Make certain your water heater's water supply is shut off, as is the electricity running to the unit.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI.
