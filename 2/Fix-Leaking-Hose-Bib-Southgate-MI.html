<p>Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable water supply within a structure these devices are called seclusion" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no other way to supply one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>

In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, permitting air to enter the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
