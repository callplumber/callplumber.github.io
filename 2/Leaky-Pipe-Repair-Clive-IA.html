<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals discovered in water. Usually, minerals arrive due to the fact that groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water until it is in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to eliminate liquified minerals that aren't as efficiently gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers difficult water.</p>

When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that just initial factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
