The membrane has pores big enough to confess water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is free of solidity ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
