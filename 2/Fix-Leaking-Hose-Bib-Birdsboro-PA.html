<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the style of each component. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
