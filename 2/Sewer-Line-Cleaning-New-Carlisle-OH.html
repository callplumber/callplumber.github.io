When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
