<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber South River NJ</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the support of a professional. Some minor clogs can be looked after with a plunger and typically, when the toilet will not stop running, it's a basic matter of changing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. Nevertheless, specific concerns do require a qualified plumber, and it's important to know the difference to avoid squandered aggravation, cash, and time.</p>
