<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Felton DE</h3>
<p>A freshly installed water heater must not produce odd noises, but it will start to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat the water. Things intensify considerably for households with a high need for hot water. The reasons for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. A hot water heater replacement may be needed if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
