<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>Individuals who write these articles should be thoughtful of the consumer and the professional provider. Don't do an injustice to these people by being so narrow minded in your guidance. See all of the possibilities. Then write a well notified short article. Once the FutureSoft water softener is set up, you will not have a slippery feel to the water as you would have with a salt-based water softener. This doesn't imply it's not working. FutureSoft is not adding any salt to the water and is retaining the essential, healthy minerals in your water.</p>
