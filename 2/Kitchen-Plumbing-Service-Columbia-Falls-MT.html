This results in micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to go into the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
