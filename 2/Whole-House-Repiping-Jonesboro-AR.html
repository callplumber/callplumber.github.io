<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- usually sodium. The outcome is water that's been successfully softened by eliminating nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute hard water.</p>
