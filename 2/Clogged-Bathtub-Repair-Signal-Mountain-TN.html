<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning team is happy to utilize Bio-Clean items for every drain-cleaning task. Bio-Clean is an all-natural solution that's both safe to your plumbing and incredibly effective at eliminating gunk, waste, and organic product that so typically clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and just partly fixing the issue. Bio-Clean is a solution of live germs that actively look for organic material and gnaw at it, developing harmless byproducts of carbon mineral, dioxide, and water ash, all of which are easily dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
