<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Apple Creek OH</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

<p>The issue of leak can be attributed to any number of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, as well as poor maintenance. The water heater tank should have some room to represent the expansion that occurs when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to leave, thus the need for an expansion tank to assist control the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force applied by the growth happening when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to break and start leaking. The solution for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
