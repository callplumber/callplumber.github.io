<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company at Long Island City NY 11101</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
