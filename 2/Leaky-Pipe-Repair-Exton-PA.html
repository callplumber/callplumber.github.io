<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Exton PA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Likewise known as cabling, we snake a coiled metal wire down the pipe while we rotate on our end to unclog drains. This technique works best for clearing out drains clogged with hair and particles, such as showers and sinks.
