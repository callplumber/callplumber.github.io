<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a very important part of the style of each part. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities.

Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
