<p>Once you have actually found the trip lever you desire, all you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the appropriate method. When you've secured the trip lever and are ready to attach your flapper, make sure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
