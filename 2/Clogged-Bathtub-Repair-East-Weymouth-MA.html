<p>Your home's drains and pipes silently get rid of thousands of gallons of wastewater from your house every year without you even giving them a reservation. However, when hair, food scraps, feminine hygiene products, toys, and other foreign things make their way into your drains, they can lead to serious problems. While in some cases it's obvious you need drain cleaning (when your bathroom sink is completely stopped-up, or there's gurgling in your kitchen drains, for example), it can sometimes be harder to tell if you have a concern on your hands.</p>
<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural stability of the system.

Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>
