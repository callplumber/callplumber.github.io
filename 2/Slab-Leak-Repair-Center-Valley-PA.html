The City needs backflow prevention devices to be set up anywhere there exists a connection that could allow tainted water into the City system or personal plumbing. These gadgets go through testing by a qualified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In a lot of cases, they are subject to routine tests later on, too.</p>
