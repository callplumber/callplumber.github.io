<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to prevent backflow. The standard ways of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
