<p>Many homes or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
