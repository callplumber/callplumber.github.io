<p>Leakages are tricky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Many homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather protection. As the external finish of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can result in incorrect drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
