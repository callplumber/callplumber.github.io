<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Mesa AZ 85204</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements.

Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
