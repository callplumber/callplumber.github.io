It could be in need of significant repairs or it could be nearing the end of its life expectancy if your disposal is regularly making noises that are unusual for the machine. Frequent obstructions, even when you're hardly washing down any food particles, could indicate a problem with the disposal. It is most likely due to too much usage over a long duration of time if there are leaks coming from your system. A lot of these leakages can be repaired, however if they become bigger and more regular, you must consider total system replacement.</p>
