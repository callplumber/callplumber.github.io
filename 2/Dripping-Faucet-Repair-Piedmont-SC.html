<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible option, specifically when easy plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
