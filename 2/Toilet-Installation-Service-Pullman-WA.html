This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the external coating of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
