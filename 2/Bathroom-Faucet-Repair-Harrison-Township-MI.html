<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another appointment. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Homeowners can practice preventive maintenance to prevent future drainage problems. Once a. month, use a plunger in your shower and tub drains to eliminate any stuck-on particles. Put hot water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice cubes and salt in the garbage disposal to get rid of grease.
