Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
