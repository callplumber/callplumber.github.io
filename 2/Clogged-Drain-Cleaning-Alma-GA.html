After all, isn't all water soft? Fair point. However water softeners were developed to fight a surprisingly common problem: difficult water.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, dishwasher, and heater, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In severe cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically limit the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
