When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
