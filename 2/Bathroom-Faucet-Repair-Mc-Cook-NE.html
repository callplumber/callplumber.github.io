<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler generally are set up in locations where water could trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it often ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, especially in locations where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green discolorations being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks.</p>
