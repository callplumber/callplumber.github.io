Our waste disposal unit repair specialists can diagnose any issue that may develop with your unit, and we can help you pick between repair and replacement. Routine maintenance is a great way to do so if you want to remain ahead of repairs.</p>

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be removed and changed with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that only initial factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to use and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
