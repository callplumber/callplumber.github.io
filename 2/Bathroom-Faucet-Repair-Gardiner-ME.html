<h3>When To Call A Plumber Gardiner ME</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>This article aims to address the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: an effectively configured water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a couple of confusing facts that typically lead people to this incorrect conclusion. First, naturally soft water is generally corrosive. Therefore, softened water must also be destructive, best? This is a fallacy due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
