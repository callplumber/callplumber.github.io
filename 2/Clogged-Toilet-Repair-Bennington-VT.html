<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Bennington VT</h3>
<p>No warm water-- The lack of warm water is the most significant sign that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio hot water heater.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of.

That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
