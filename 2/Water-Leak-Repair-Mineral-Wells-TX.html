<p>Water softeners add worth to your operation by securing your water-using equipment from poor performance and premature failure. Some hard water problems are really visible, like sprayers and dispensers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go undetected, like scale on water heater aspects and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Noticeable or invisible, these problems have actually real expenses connected with them. Clogged fixtures trigger replacement or refurbishing expenses and can annoy your customers. Scale buildup in your hot water heater will inflate your energy expenses, and prematurely damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement costs. Quickly, these little costs can add up to make a genuine influence on your bottom line.</p>
