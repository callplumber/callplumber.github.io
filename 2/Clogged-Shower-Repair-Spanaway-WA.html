<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and complex plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. Doing the job by a professional from Art Plumbing, A/C & Electric will prevent extra expenses, dangers and inexpedient purchases. We will be able to inform if a new disposal is required, guide you on what will match your needs best, and take care of the installation in addition to follow up maintenance. Art Plumbing, A/C & Electric is equipped for all your waste disposal unit and home plumbing requirements.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are harmless, however over time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
