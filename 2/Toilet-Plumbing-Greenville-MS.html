<p>Just like kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your sink, shower, or bathtub) can be fixed easily if the blockage is easy and shallow. For many clogs you'll just need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, but if this does not fix the issue then you might also have to contact a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is likewise harder to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
