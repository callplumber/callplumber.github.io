<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
