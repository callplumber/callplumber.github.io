<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
<p>Replaced 50 gallon electric hot water heater, thermal growth tank, and pressure regulator valve. When the majority of people think of plumbers, they normally call them for water pipe problems.
