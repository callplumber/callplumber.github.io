<h3>Drain Cleaning in Marengo IL 60152 : What You Need To Know?</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>Reminder: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I recently had several plumbing leaks repaired and couldn't be better with the prompt service I received from Parker and Sons. They are really well-informed, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would absolutely recommend them to my household and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
<p>Bugs. Sadly, a damaged main sewer line can also lead to undesirable pests inside your house. Insects and rats can quickly squeeze through fractures and gaps in your sewer line and find their way into your plumbing. These insects can be very hazardous to your health. A plumber can perform a visual inspection of your sewer line if you think you have bugs in your plumbing.</p>
<p>Unless you have firsthand experience in the plumbing market, allow a professional to deal with the installation. We'll send a skilled service technician to your house when you call Pratt Plumbing. He or she will treat you with the utmost respect and courtesy. They'll respond to any questions you provide and have suggestions on the appropriate usage of a disposal system.</p>
