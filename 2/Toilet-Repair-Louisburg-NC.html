Most of the times, the homeowner is responsible for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one instructions. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always stream toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The demand upstream might trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
