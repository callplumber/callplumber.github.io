The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
