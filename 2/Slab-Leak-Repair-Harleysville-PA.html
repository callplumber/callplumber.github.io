<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler usually are installed in areas where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system.
