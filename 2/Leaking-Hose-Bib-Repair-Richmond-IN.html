When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
