<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Glen Allen VA 23060</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Gas lines are a wonderful, more affordable energy alternative for house owners and commercial homeowner alike. This has actually made gas lines more common and improvements in technology have made the harnessing of natural gas relatively safe. Nevertheless, gas lines are one of the most forgotten functions to a house or service and yet, one of the most essential. They can also become the most unsafe and hazardous if left unattended.</p>
<p>Nothing is more aggravating than turning on a tap and observing the water gather in the bottom of your sink or tub. Slow-draining or standing water is typically an indication of a clogged drain problem. This drain repair problem impacts many Tyler, TX homeowners, which is why Super Plumbers focuses on professional drain pipe unblocking services.
