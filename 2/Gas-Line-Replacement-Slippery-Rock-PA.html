Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide.

If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the motion (instead of consistent or direct) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
