<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

Ponding or standing water from leaking sewer lines are also a health threat and often go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also weaken your drain system and cause separations.

Frequently, pipes or water service lines are replaced, only to discover they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not constantly dirty or discolored and frequently gets incorrect for a water supply line leak.</p>
