<p>Diane Heether is a city citizen of Belding and she is grateful for having a water softener set up in her home. It didn't simply enhance and make cleaning much easier, but it helps minimize waste as well. A backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve plan developed to avoid the turnaround of the flow of water once it has actually travelled through the valve.
