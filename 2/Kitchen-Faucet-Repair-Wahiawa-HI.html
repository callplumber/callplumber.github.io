This is just among numerous problems that can surface.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
