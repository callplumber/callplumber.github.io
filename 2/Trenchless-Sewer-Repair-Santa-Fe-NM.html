<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers Santa Fe NM</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems need the assistance of a professional. Some small clogs can be taken care of with a plunger and often, when the toilet will not stop running, it's a simple matter of changing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. However, particular problems do call for an experienced plumber, and it is necessary to know the distinction to avoid squandered money, time, and aggravation.</p>
