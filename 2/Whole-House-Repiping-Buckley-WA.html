<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent.

This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to get in the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
