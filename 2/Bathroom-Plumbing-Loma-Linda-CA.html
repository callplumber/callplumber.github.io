<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others.

<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- essentially 2 layers of protection. The device permits water to press the check valves open when water is entering the building, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect method. There are two different types of testable backflow prevention devices that are typically defined-- a minimized pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a few others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. I mention them just since they will be on a certification test.</p>
