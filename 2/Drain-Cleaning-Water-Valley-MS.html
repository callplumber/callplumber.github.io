<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
