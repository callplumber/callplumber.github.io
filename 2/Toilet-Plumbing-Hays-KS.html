As soon as the FutureSoft water softener is set up, you will not have a slippery feel to the water as you would have with a salt-based water softener. This does not mean it's not working. FutureSoft is not adding any sodium to the water and is maintaining the crucial, healthy minerals in your water.</p>
<p>It's a strangely intricate clinical procedure, but simple to treat. It uses salt to remove minerals and smells discovered in hard water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that connect and draw in salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
