<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
