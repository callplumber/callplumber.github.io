<h3>Drain Maintenance in Central South Carolina</h2>
<p>When you drop something down your drain or when you clean out a couple of hairs from the tub, it might seem like just a small annoyance. However, your drain system plays a a lot more significant part in your plumbing system than you may recognize. Your drains are put in place to safeguard your pipes from becoming clogged with hair and other particles.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return due to the fact that he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The space under your kitchen sink has actually gotten more congested over the years. Originally, there would have been a cold and hot water line increasing to the faucet (normally with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap. Using liquid epoxy-resin solutions, trenchless specialists can cure in-place entire new areas of pipe within your damaged line, through small or even pre-existing entry points.</p>
