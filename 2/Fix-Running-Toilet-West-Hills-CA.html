To get rid of the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the large, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
