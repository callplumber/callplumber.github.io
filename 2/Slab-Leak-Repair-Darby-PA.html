<p>Water softeners leakages are mostly triggered since of a concern at the point of installation or because of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. It can also trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is split. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or replaced over time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration processes. A used water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely split and merely needs to be replaced.</p>
