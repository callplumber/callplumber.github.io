<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are convenient if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
