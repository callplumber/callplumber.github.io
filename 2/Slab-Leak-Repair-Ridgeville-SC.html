<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
