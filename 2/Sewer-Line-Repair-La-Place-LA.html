<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair in La Place LA 70068</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>There are several brands of sink for the bath, utility, and kitchen room, and you can pick from sink products like porcelain or ceramic, enameled stainless steel, plain stainless-steel, and even plastic. Thankfully, all sinks work practically the exact same method, and follow the same standard style. Candu Pros can service sinks from all the major brand names. If you're changing sink hardware like faucets or drains, your Candu Pro can assist with that, too.</p>
