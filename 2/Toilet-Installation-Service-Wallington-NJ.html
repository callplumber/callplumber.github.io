<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical service, especially when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
