<p>Cold showers? High energy costs? It may be time for a new warm water heater. But in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it set up appropriately. A hot water heater that is not set up correctly can result in water damage, scalding temperatures, or even a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>

When that takes place, you will probably need to call a plumber anyway to fix your mistakes, and opportunities are they will cost more and be harder than if you had actually just called a professional in the first place.</p>

You need to also check the inspections needed for your job.</p>
