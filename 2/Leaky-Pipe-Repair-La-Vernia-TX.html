<p>Pictures provided by the American Backflow Prevention Association. The cost to repipe a house with copper pipe is in between $8,000 and $16,000 or about $3 to $8 per linear foot. Changing galvanized drain, waste, and vent pipe with copper costs $13 to $15 per linear foot. Copper pipe is more expensive than PEX, however it has some excellent advantages.

<p>The typical service is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many years, however steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
