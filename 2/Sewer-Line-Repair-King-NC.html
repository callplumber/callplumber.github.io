<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property. The camera is manually controlled on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light offers a clear image for the technician to precisely examine conditions and detect the functionality of the pipes. The details we obtain from the inspection permits us to make an informed decision regarding the condition of your pipes and advise the very best service also. If the pipe needs to be cleaned up of blockages or relined with epoxy resin, we can make the ideal recommendation with self-confidence.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
