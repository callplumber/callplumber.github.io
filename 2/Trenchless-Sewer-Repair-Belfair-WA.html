<h3>Drain Cleaning in Belfair WA 98528 : What You Need To Know?</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>There are several brand names of sink for the bath, energy, and kitchen room, and you can choose from sink materials like porcelain or ceramic, enameled stainless-steel, plain stainless-steel, and even plastic. Fortunately, all sinks work pretty much the same method, and follow the same standard style. Candu Pros can service sinks from all the significant brand names. If you're replacing sink hardware like faucets or drains, your Candu Pro can assist with that, too.</p>
<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on 3 different celebrations, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were fantastic. They rapidly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a huge mess. They, similar to everyone we have actually experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, timely, and very educated. I would suggest Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either little or big task plumbing work.</p>
