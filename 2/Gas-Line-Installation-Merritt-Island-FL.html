Continuous feed disposals are easy to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal debris can sometimes get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>

These devices are frequently integrated into single items to increase their effectiveness, such as check valve assemblies (including 2 successive independent check valves (DCVA)) and Reverse-pressure concept backflow preventers (two inline check valves with a pressure relief valve situated in between them to dispose out any backflow water (RPD)).</p>
