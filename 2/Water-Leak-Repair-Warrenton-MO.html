<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are installed in areas where water might cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Mamba Drain Inspections is so terrific! The gentleman came out and scoped out my sewer line from a cleanout for a low-cost price and referred me to a contractor that does sewer repairs for other huge companies without the significant increased cost.

It's easy to forget about your water heater till there's an issue since these devices are typically out of sight and out of mind.

<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To remove the disposer, support it from below and turn the big, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away. Eliminate the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
