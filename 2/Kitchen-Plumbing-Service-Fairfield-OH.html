<p>Depending on the size of your home, repiping may take anywhere from a couple of days to a week. Usually, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires complete water shut down while you are out and about during the day, so you experience very little interruption to your daily routine. To start the repiping process, the plumbing group will first cover any carpet and furniture to protect them from dust and debris. They will then make little cuts in the wall and drywall to find the pipes and then get rid of and replace them, leaving as much of the initial building material as possible intact.</p>
