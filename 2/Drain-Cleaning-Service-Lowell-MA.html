<h3>When To Call A Plumber Lowell MA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
