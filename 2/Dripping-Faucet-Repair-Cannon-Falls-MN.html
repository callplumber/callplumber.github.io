When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to pass through. Due to the fact that of the tight area, the pipes frequently make unusual gurgling noises as water efforts to go through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are available, leading to the odd sounds originating from your sink.</p>
