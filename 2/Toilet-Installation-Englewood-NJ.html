Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
