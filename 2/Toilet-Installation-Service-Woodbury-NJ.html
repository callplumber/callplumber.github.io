<p>Offered there isn't a tank failure, generally a commercial water heater can be fixed, however is it worth repairing? Only after addressing the following concerns must you answer repair or replace. Do you know how many years old your water heater is? Do you understand how many years it's rated for? Think about replacement rather of repair if it is close to the number of years the water heater was ranked for.</p>
