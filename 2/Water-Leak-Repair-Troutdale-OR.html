<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Troutdale OR 97060</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
