<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
