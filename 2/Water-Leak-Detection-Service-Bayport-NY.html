At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
