<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Ridgecrest CA 93555</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
