Constant feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste.

<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I recently had several plumbing leakages fixed and could not be better with the timely service I received from Parker and Sons. They are extremely knowledgeable, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would definitely recommend them to my household and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in the house.</p>
